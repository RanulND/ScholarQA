{"Title": "Highly-Efficient Hardware Architecture for CRYSTALS-Kyber With a Novel Conflict-Free Memory Access Pattern", "Authors": ["w. guo", "s. li"], "Pub Date": "2023-10-25", "Abstract": "the attack on quantum computers is an enormous threat to conventional public key cryptography. hence it is crucial to study quantum resistant cryptosystems. after four rounds of evaluation the national institute of standards and technology  nist  has decided to standardize crystals kyber as one of the public key post quantum cryptography  pqc  algorithms. in the hardware design of crystals kyber the polynomial related calculations are the most time consuming. in this paper we present a highly efficient hardware architecture for crystals kyber. firstly we propose the crystals kyber oriented conflict free memory mapping scheme with two modes. based on this scheme we construct the mixed radix 2/4 ntt intt algorithm which has no pre  or post processing for the first time. by using the \u201a\u00e4\u00falazy last layer\u201a\u00e4\u00f9 trick the available memory bandwidth of ntt is temporarily increased and the average performance of ntt is improved. besides the point wise multiplication  pwm  is performed in a single memory bank by cooperating with the two modes of our memory mapping scheme. this avoids the waste of memory bandwidth thus avoiding the usage of large fifos for the sampled data. last we propose an efficient modular multiplier for crystals kyber and we merge the divide by 2 operations in the finite field into modular adders and subtractors to reduce resource consumption. this design which supports all three security levels is implemented on xilinx artix 7 fpga with 7.3k luts 3.2k ffs 2.2k slices 5 brams and 4 dsps. it performs 12% better in area time product than other leading designs in the literature.", "Doi": "10.1109/TCSI.2023.3306347", "Key Words": ["crystals-kyber", "post-quantum cryptography", "mixed radix-2/4 ntt", "conflict-free", "modular multiplication"]}
