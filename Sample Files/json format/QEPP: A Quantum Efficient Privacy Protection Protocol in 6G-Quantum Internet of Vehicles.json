{"Title": "QEPP: A Quantum Efficient Privacy Protection Protocol in 6G-Quantum Internet of Vehicles", "Authors": ["z. qu", "z. chen", "x. ning", "p. tiwari"], "Pub Date": "2024-02-22", "Abstract": "the increasing popularity of 6g communication within the internet of vehicles  iov  ecosystem is expected to induce a surge in both user numbers and data volumes. this expansion will cause substantial challenges in ensuring network security and privacy protection as well as in addressing the associated issue of inadequate cloud computing resources. in this article we propose a quantum efficient privacy protection  qepp  protocol that leverages reversible information hiding in quantum point clouds. this protocol utilizes quantum communication technology in edge to cloud communication of the iov to transmit sensitive information embedded in quantum state data thereby ensuring privacy protection. it employs quantum error correction coding and efficient coding techniques to extract information and recover the carriers. in addition the protocol utilizes an improved quantum grover algorithm in the cloud to accelerate the processing speed of quantum data. by addressing security vulnerabilities and improving cloud computing capabilities the qepp can effectively accommodate critical requirements including precision timeliness and robust privacy protection.", "Doi": "10.1109/TIV.2023.3304852", "Key Words": ["privacy protection", "quantum reversible information hiding", "quantum point cloud", "quantum search algorithm"]}
