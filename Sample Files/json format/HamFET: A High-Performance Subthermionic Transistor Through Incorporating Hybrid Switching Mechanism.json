{"Title": "HamFET: A High-Performance Subthermionic Transistor Through Incorporating Hybrid Switching Mechanism", "Authors": ["q. huang", "s. xu", "r. huang"], "Pub Date": "2024-02-12", "Abstract": "field effect transistors  fets  switched by quantum band to band tunneling  btbt  mechanism rather than conventional thermionic emission mechanism are emerging as an exciting device candidate for future ultralow power electronics due to their exceptional electronic properties of subthermionic subthreshold swing. however fundamental limitations in drive current have hindered such technology encountering for high performance and high speed operations especially for silicon based device. here we demonstrate a novel pathway of integrating tunneling and thermionic emission mechanisms together to circumvent their respective limitation and design a hybrid adaptively modulated fet  hamfet  that orients power saving and performance enhancement simultaneously. this transistor architecture utilizing a nested source configuration without cost or area penalties exhibits both ultrasteep  subthermionic  subthreshold swing and the largest \u201a\u00e4\u00faon\u201a\u00e4\u00f9 and \u201a\u00e4\u00faoff\u201a\u00e4\u00f9 current ratio over the state of the art tunneling transistors. our design methodology of hybrid switching mechanism is also applicable to other mechanism material and architecture systems opening the doors to a range of high speed application opportunities for ultralow power but performance insufficient electronics.", "Doi": "10.1109/JXCDC.2023.3338480", "Key Words": ["hybrid switching mechanism", "tunneling transistors", "ultralow-power electronics", "ultrasteep subthreshold swing"]}
