{"Title": "A Secure Information Transmission Protocol for Healthcare Cyber Based on Quantum Image Expansion and Grover Search Algorithm", "Authors": ["z. qu", "h. sun"], "Pub Date": "2023-09-20", "Abstract": "in the healthcare cyber the transmission of information between the head office and each sub branch has always been a very important process. however with the continuous development of network technology in recent years its security has also been subjected to greater and greater tests. based on quantum image expansion technology and grover search algorithm this paper proposes a more secure and large capacity secure information transmission protocol for healthcare cyber. the new protocol embeds the secret information through three layers and encrypts it at the same time. finally the secret information is transmitted through quantum channel in the form of quantum state which has very high security. at the same time the new protocol is essentially a novel quantum image steganography protocol. the imperceptibility of the steganography protocol is essentially a higher level of security which can effectively avoid various attacks and further guarantee the security of the information transmission process.", "Doi": "10.1109/TNSE.2022.3187861", "Key Words": ["quantum image expansion", "grover search algorithm", "healthcare information transmission", "security", "capacity", "quantum image steganography"]}
