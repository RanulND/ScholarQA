{"Title": "Moderate Deviation Expansion for Fully Quantum Tasks", "Authors": ["n. ramakrishnan", "m. tomamichel", "m. berta"], "Pub Date": "2023-07-13", "Abstract": "the moderate deviation regime is concerned with the finite block length trade off between communication cost and error for information processing tasks in the asymptotic regime where the communication cost approaches a capacity like quantity and the error vanishes at the same time. we find exact characterisations of these trade offs for a variety of fully quantum communication tasks including quantum source coding quantum state splitting entanglement assisted quantum channel coding and entanglement assisted quantum channel simulation. the main technical tool we derive is a tight relation between the partially smoothed max information and the hypothesis testing relative entropy. this allows us to obtain the expansion of the partially smoothed max information for i.i.d. states in the moderate deviation regime.", "Doi": "10.1109/TIT.2023.3262145", "Key Words": ["source coding", "channel coding", "channel capacity", "entropy", "information theory", "quantum mechanics"]}
