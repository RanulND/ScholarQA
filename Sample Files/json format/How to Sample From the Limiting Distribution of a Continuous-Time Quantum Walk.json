{"Title": "How to Sample From the Limiting Distribution of a Continuous-Time Quantum Walk", "Authors": ["j. doliskani"], "Pub Date": "2023-10-20", "Abstract": "we introduce  $\\varepsilon $  projectors using which we can sample from limiting distributions of continuous time quantum walks. the standard algorithm for sampling from a distribution that is close to the limiting distribution of a given quantum walk is to run the quantum walk for a time chosen uniformly at random from a large interval and measure the resulting quantum state. this approach usually results in an exponential running time. we show that using  $\\varepsilon $  projectors we can sample exactly from the limiting distribution. in the black box setting where we only have query access to the adjacency matrix of the graph our sampling algorithm runs in time proportional to  $\\delta ^{ 1}$  where  $\\delta $  is the minimum spacing between the distinct eigenvalues of the graph. in the non black box setting we give examples of graphs for which our algorithm runs exponentially faster than the standard sampling algorithm.", "Doi": "10.1109/TIT.2023.3287556", "Key Words": ["quantum walk", "epsilon projector", "quasi-abelian graph", "isogeny graph"]}
