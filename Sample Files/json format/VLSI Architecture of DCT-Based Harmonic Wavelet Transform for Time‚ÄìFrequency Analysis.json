{"Title": "VLSI Architecture of DCT-Based Harmonic Wavelet Transform for Time\u201a\u00c4\u00ecFrequency Analysis", "Authors": ["p. khatua", "k. c. ray"], "Pub Date": "2023-04-06", "Abstract": "the complex harmonic wavelet  chw  is being used to directly compute frequency content with respect to time by employing discrete fourier transform  dft  and inverse dft  idft . however dft coefficients suffer severe leakage of energy from one band to another band of frequency. the leakage between bands is minimized by employing discrete cosine transform  dct  in the harmonic wavelet transform  hwt  which leads to a better representation of the time\u201a\u00e4\u00ecfrequency spectrum. this article introduces a new vlsi architecture for dct  based harmonic wavelet for hardware implementation and prototyped on a commercially available virtex5 field programmable gate array  fpga   xc5vlx110t . to validate the proposed implementation its real time captured results in the logic analyzer are verified with simulation results. the maximum operating frequency targeting the fpga mentioned above device is reported as 114.34 mhz. the total on chip power of the above implementation is 1.102 w out of which 68 mw is the dynamic power dissipation at a toggle rate of 12%. finally for the area utilization of the above implementation its resource utilization targeting the above fpga device is reported.", "Doi": "10.1109/TIM.2023.3259023", "Key Words": ["complex harmonic wavelet (chw)", "discrete cosine transform (dct)-ii-based harmonic wavelet", "field programmable gate array (fpga) prototype", "spectral leakage", "time-frequency analysis", "vlsi architecture"]}
