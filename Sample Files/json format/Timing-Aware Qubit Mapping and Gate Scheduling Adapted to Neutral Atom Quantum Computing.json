{"Title": "Timing-Aware Qubit Mapping and Gate Scheduling Adapted to Neutral Atom Quantum Computing", "Authors": ["y. li", "y. zhang", "m. chen", "x. li", "p. xu"], "Pub Date": "2023-10-19", "Abstract": "as a less developed but potential quantum technology neutral atoms  nas  can provide advantages including higher qubit connectivity longer range interactions and much more native multicontrol gates than superconductivity. long range interactions however prevent parallelism of interacting qubit pairs with their surrounding restriction zones. therefore the quantum program cannot be run directly on an na quantum computer  naqc  unless compiled. the recent compiling study of naqc applies simple layer by layer scheduling and does not consider the difference in gate duration. to address the above issues we focus on the qubit mapping and quantum gate scheduling  m&s  problem of quantum circuits to meet hardware constraints of superconductivity and even nas. our goal is to shorten the execution time to mitigate decoherence noise. we propose a block game like abstraction mechanism tetris which is an abstract model of the m&s problem and aware of the duration difference of gates and several other na characteristics. based on the abstraction we propose a heuristic greedy algorithm  hga  to solve the m&s problem efficiently. to further speed up the execution of the circuit we embed hga into a monte carlo tree search  mcts  framework to solve the m&s problem which consumes more compiling time but achieves a better result. comparing our mcts algorithm with the only recent m&s algorithm for naqc the average speedup ratio is  $1.75\\times $  for several quantum circuits collected from revlib and  $1.18\\times $  for circuits from qiskit lib.", "Doi": "10.1109/TCAD.2023.3261244", "Key Words": ["neutral atom (na)", "noisy intermediate quantum computers", "parallelism", "quantum compilation", "quantum computing (qc)", "qubit mapping"]}
