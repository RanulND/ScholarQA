{"Title": "SLMGAN: Exploiting Speech Language Model Representations for Unsupervised Zero-Shot Voice Conversion in GANs", "Doi": "10.1109/WASPAA58266.2023.10248117", "Authors": ["y. a. li", "c. han", "n. mesgarani"], "Key Words": ["voice conversion", "large language model", "generative adversarial networks"], "Abstract": "in recent years large scale pre trained speech language models  slms  have demonstrated remarkable advancements in various generative speech modeling applications such as text to speech synthesis voice conversion and speech enhancement. these applications typically involve mapping text or speech inputs to pretrained slm representations from which target speech is decoded. this paper introduces a new approach slmgan to leverage slm representations for discriminative tasks within the generative adversarial network  gan  framework specifically for voice conversion. building upon starganv2 vc we add our novel slm based wavlm discriminators on top of the mel based discriminators along with our newly designed slm feature matching loss function resulting in an unsupervised zero shot voice conversion system that does not require text labels during training. subjective evaluation results show that slmgan outperforms existing state of the art zero shot voice conversion models in terms of naturalness and achieves comparable similarity highlighting the potential of slm based discriminators for related applications.", "Pub Date": "2023-09-15"}
