{"Title": "Analytical Modeling of Multiple Co-Existing Inaccuracies in RF Controlling Circuits for Superconducting Quantum Computing", "Authors": ["y. tong", "q. chen"], "Pub Date": "2023-12-22", "Abstract": "quantum computers based on spin qubits and superconducting qubits require radio frequency  rf  electronic circuits to control and read out the state. as the scale of the quantum processors increases the inaccuracy in the rf circuit becomes an increasingly significant source of nonidealities that impacts the qubit operations. in this article we propose a closed form model to characterize the effects of inaccuracies in the controlling rf circuits on the fidelity of single qubit control operation of superconducting qubits. different from previous works our model allows characterization of multiple inaccuracies at the same time significantly enhancing the guidance capabilities for practical quantum computing hardware design and optimization. in addition the accuracy of the proposed model is also verified by a quantum classical co simulator.", "Doi": "10.1109/TCAD.2023.3311732", "Key Words": ["co-simulation", "nonidealities", "quantum computing", "qubit control", "superconducting qubit"]}
