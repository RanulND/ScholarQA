{"Title": "A Quantum Probability Driven Framework for Joint Multi-Modal Sarcasm, Sentiment and Emotion Analysis", "Authors": ["y. liu", "y. zhang", "d. song"], "Pub Date": "2024-02-29", "Abstract": "sarcasm sentiment and emotion are three typical kinds of spontaneous affective responses of humans to external events and they are tightly intertwined with each other. such events may be expressed in multiple modalities  e.g. linguistic visual and acoustic  e.g. multi modal conversations. joint analysis of humans\u201a\u00e4\u00f4 multi modal sarcasm sentiment and emotion is an important yet challenging topic as it is a complex cognitive process involving both cross modality interaction and cross affection correlation. from the probability theory perspective cross affection correlation also means that the judgments on sarcasm sentiment and emotion are incompatible. however this exposed phenomenon cannot be sufficiently modelled by classical probability theory due to its assumption of compatibility. neither do the existing approaches take it into consideration. in view of the recent success of quantum probability  qp  in modeling human cognition particularly contextual incompatible decision making we take the first step towards introducing qp into joint multi modal sarcasm sentiment and emotion analysis. specifically we propose a quantum probability driven multi modal sarcasm sentiment and emotion analysis framework termed quiet. extensive experiments on two datasets and the results show that the effectiveness and advantages of quiet in comparison with a wide range of the state of the art baselines. we also show the great potential of qp in multi affect analysis.", "Doi": "10.1109/TAFFC.2023.3279145", "Key Words": ["emotion recognition", "multi-modal framework", "quantum probability", "sarcasm detection", "sentiment analysis"]}
