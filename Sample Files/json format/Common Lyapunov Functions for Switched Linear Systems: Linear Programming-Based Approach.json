{"Title": "Common Lyapunov Functions for Switched Linear Systems: Linear Programming-Based Approach", "Authors": ["s. andersen", "p. giesl", "s. hafstein"], "Pub Date": "2022-12-21", "Abstract": "we study the stability of an equilibrium of arbitrarily switched autonomous continuous time systems through the computation of a common lyapunov function  clf . the switching occurs between a finite number of individual subsystems each of which is assumed to be linear. we present a linear programming  lp  based approach to compute a continuous and piecewise affine  cpa  clf and compare this approach with different methods in the literature. in particular we compare it with the prevalent use of linear matrix inequalities  lmis  and semidefinite optimization to parameterize a quadratic common lyapunov function  qclf  for the linear subsystems.", "Doi": "10.1109/LCSYS.2022.3228857", "Key Words": ["common lyapunov function", "linear matrix inequalities", "linear programming", "linear systems", "switched systems"]}
