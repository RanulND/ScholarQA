{"Title": "A Quantum Adaptation for the Morra Game and Some of Its Variants", "Authors": ["a. c. marceddu", "b. montrucchio"], "Pub Date": "2024-03-18", "Abstract": "the morra game is quite old. back in time traces of it can be found in ancient egypt ancient rome and even china. it involves two players who for a limited number of turns must try to suppose the sum of the number personally chosen with the number chosen by the opponent. the rules are simple but it is rather difficult to play at a high level as there are multiple cognitive motor and perceptual processes involved. the goal of this article is to illustrate the process of implementing a quantum random player for the morra game and some of its variants. this can be done by using a quantum number generator circuit to generate two numbers and a quantum adder to obtain the supposed sum. the advantage of this proposal is that unlike the implementations of the morra game on classical computers which only allow the generation of pseudorandom numbers true randomness can be obtained through quantum computing. in addition to the description of the entire algorithms the source code of the implementations is provided to give everyone the freedom to easily test both the quantum implementation of the morra game and the variants discussed in this article.", "Doi": "10.1109/TG.2023.3251663", "Key Words": ["active perception", "cognitive processes", "games", "neuropsychology", "programming", "quantum computing"]}
