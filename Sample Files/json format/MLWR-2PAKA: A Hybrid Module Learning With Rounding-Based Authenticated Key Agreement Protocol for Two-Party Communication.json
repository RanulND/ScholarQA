{"Title": "MLWR-2PAKA: A Hybrid Module Learning With Rounding-Based Authenticated Key Agreement Protocol for Two-Party Communication", "Authors": ["s. basu", "k. seyhan", "s. h. islam", "s. akleylek"], "Pub Date": "2023-12-12", "Abstract": "the two party authenticated key agreement  2paka  protocol allows two users to generate a shared session key between themselves over a public channel without any assistance from a centralized server. many of the state of the art 2paka protocols are not secure in quantum environments. this article proposes a hybrid module learning with rounding  mlwr  based 2paka  mlwr 2paka  protocol for the post quantum world. the constructed mlwr 2paka protocol provides entity authentication based on the saber scheme. the hardness assumption of mlwr 2paka relies on mlwr since it does not require any complex reduction and sampling processes. the security analysis is done in the random oracle model based on the basic dolev\u201a\u00e4\u00ecyao threat model. in addition the chosen reconciliation structure makes the session keys unbiased. by using different parameter sets a comparison analysis is presented regarding key sizes failure probability and bandwidth requirements.", "Doi": "10.1109/JSYST.2023.3288629", "Key Words": ["authenticated key agreement (aka)", "lattice-based cryptography", "module learning with rounding (mlwr)", "post-quantum cryptography", "random oracle model"]}
