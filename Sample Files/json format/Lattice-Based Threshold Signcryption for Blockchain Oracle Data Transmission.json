{"Title": "Lattice-Based Threshold Signcryption for Blockchain Oracle Data Transmission", "Authors": ["h. yu", "h. wang"], "Pub Date": "2023-10-04", "Abstract": "threshold signature can solve the problems of high cost and network congestion during the execution of smart contracts. however the information transmitted in public links is vulnerable to eavesdropping tampering and other network attacks it is essential to ensure the confidentiality and integrity during data transmission. however traditional threshold signcryption is not suitable for blockchain setting and cannot withstand the quantum computing attacks. in view of these reasons one lattice based threshold signcryption for blockchain oracle data transmission  bcodt ltsc  is devised in this article. bcodt ltsc satisfies the existential unforgeability confidentiality and threshold characteristic  it has very low computation cost and is suitable for the application in blockchain scenario.", "Doi": "10.1109/TITS.2023.3276920", "Key Words": ["lattice", "blockchain", "threshold signcryption", "smart contract"]}
