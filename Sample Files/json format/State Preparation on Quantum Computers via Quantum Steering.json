{"Title": "State Preparation on Quantum Computers via Quantum Steering", "Authors": ["d. volya", "p. mishra"], "Pub Date": "2024-03-07", "Abstract": "quantum computers present a compelling platform for the study of open quantum systems namely the nonunitary dynamics of a system. here we investigate and report digital simulations of markovian nonunitary dynamics that converge to a unique steady state. the steady state is programmed as a desired target state yielding semblance to a quantum state preparation protocol. by delegating ancilla qubits and system qubits the system state is driven to the target state by repeatedly performing the following steps  1  executing a designated system\u201a\u00e4\u00ecancilla entangling circuit  2  measuring the ancilla qubits  and 3  reinitializing ancilla qubits to known states through active reset. while the ancilla qubits are measured and reinitialized to known states the system qubits undergo a nonunitary evolution and are steered from arbitrary initial states to desired target states. we show results of the method by preparing arbitrary qubit states and qutrit  three level  states on contemporary quantum computers. we also demonstrate that the state convergence can be accelerated by utilizing the readouts of the ancilla qubits to guide the protocol in a nonblind manner. our work serves as a nontrivial example that incorporates and characterizes essential operations such as qubit reuse  qubit reset  entangling circuits and measurement. these operations are not only vital for near term noisy intermediate scale quantum applications but are also crucial for realizing future error correcting codes.", "Doi": "10.1109/TQE.2024.3358193", "Key Words": ["benchmarking", "open quantum systems", "quantum computing", "quantum control", "quantum measurement", "quantum state preparation", "quantum steering"]}
