{"Title": "AFall: Wi-Fi-Based Device-Free Fall Detection System Using Spatial Angle of Arrival", "Authors": ["s. chen", "w. yang", "y. xu", "y. geng", "b. xin", "l. huang"], "Pub Date": "2023-06-30", "Abstract": "falling is a common health problem for elderly people. early detection of falls allows earlier rescue measures to be implemented. most existing wi fi based fall detection systems employ learning based methods which require large amounts of labeled data for prior training. to address this issue we in this paper present afall a robust model based fall detection system that does not require prior training for a single person based on wi fi channel state information  csi . different from previous wi fi based fall detection systems we model the relationship between human falls and changes of angle of arrival  aoa  of wi fi signals reflected from human body by multiple signal classification  music  algorithm. in particular we deploy two receivers in orthogonal spatial layouts to capture diversified aoa information. since aoa reflected from human body is independent of environments and subjects the performance of afall can remain stable when the environment changes slightly which can meet the daily needs of the elderly people. we implement afall using commodity wi fi devices and evaluate it in five different indoor environments. the experimental results demonstrate that afall achieves an average accuracy of 84.31% and an average f1 score of 84.56%.", "Doi": "10.1109/TMC.2022.3157666", "Key Words": ["angle of arrival", "channel state information (csi)", "fall detection", "wi-fi signals"]}
