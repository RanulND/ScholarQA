{"Title": "Incentive Mechanism for Spatial Crowdsourcing With Unknown Social-Aware Workers: A Three-Stage Stackelberg Game Approach", "Authors": ["y. xu", "m. xiao", "j. wu", "s. zhang", "g. gao"], "Pub Date": "2023-06-30", "Abstract": "in this paper we investigate the incentive problem in spatial crowdsourcing  sc  where mobile social aware workers have unknown qualities and can share their answers to tasks via social networks. the objectives are to recruit high quality workers and maximize all parties\u201a\u00e4\u00f4 utilities simultaneously. however most existing works assume that the qualities of workers are known in advance or cannot take all parties\u201a\u00e4\u00f4 utilities into account together especially having not considered the impact of social networks. thus we propose an incentive mechanism based on the multi armed bandit and three stage stackelberg game called tact. we first design a greedy arm pulling scheme to recruit workers which not only can solve the exploration exploitation dilemma but also takes workers\u201a\u00e4\u00f4 social relations into account. based on the recruitment results we further design the utility functions incorporating with social benefits for workers and model the payment computation problem as a three stage stackelberg game among all participants. next we derive the optimal strategy group so that each party can maximize its own utility to form a multi win situation. moreover we theoretically prove the unique existence of stackelberg equilibrium and the worst regret bound. finally we conduct extensive simulations on a real trace to corroborate the performance of tact.", "Doi": "10.1109/TMC.2022.3157687", "Key Words": ["incentive mechanism", "multi-armed bandit", "social network", "spatial crowdsourcing", "stackelberg game"]}
