{"Title": "Oracle Indistinguishability and Its Applications", "Authors": ["a. yun"], "Pub Date": "2023-08-18", "Abstract": "there are many \u201a\u00e4\u00f2cascade type\u201a\u00e4\u00f4 constructions in symmetric key cryptography. for these the output of a prf  or a block cipher  is cascaded to the key of the next prf and this continues until all blocks of the given message are exhausted. in order to prove the security of these constructions traditionally multi oracle families together with query based hybrid arguments are used but these produce longer proofs which cannot be extended to quantum security. in this paper we point that the oracle indistinguishability first formalized by zhandry and later extended by song and yun is a useful tool for proving security of cascade type constructions both classically and quantumly. to illustrate this using oracle indistinguishability we give a classical security proof of nmac. also we prove that the rc  randomized cascade  construction which gives a prf out of a weak prf is secure both classically and quantumly.", "Doi": "10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3303575", "Key Words": ["oracle indistinguishability", "quantum security", "classical security", "pseudorandom functions", "prf", "oracle security", "nmac", "rc construction"]}
