{"Title": "On the Security of a Lattice-Based Multi-Stage Secret Sharing Scheme", "Authors": ["z. yang", "d. he", "l. qu", "j. xu"], "Pub Date": "2023-08-31", "Abstract": "in response to the threat posed by quantum computers pilaram and eghlidos proposed the first lattice based multi stage secret sharing scheme which is the only post quantum multi stage secret sharing scheme. in this paper we introduce an efficient attack on it and show that any adversary can easily reconstruct unrecovered secrets as long as it collects enough pseudo secret shares. for the sake of complete we further list two countermeasures to protect the scheme from such attack.", "Doi": "10.1109/TDSC.2022.3209011", "Key Words": ["secret sharing", "post-quantum", "lattice-based", "multi-stage"]}
