{"Title": "CRYPHTOR: A Memory-Unified NTT-Based Hardware Accelerator for Post-Quantum CRYSTALS Algorithms", "Authors": ["s. d. matteo", "i. sarno", "s. saponara"], "Pub Date": "2024-02-23", "Abstract": "this paper presents the design and fpga implementation of a hardware accelerator for the post quantum crystals kyber and crystals dilithium algorithms named cryphtor  crystals polynomial hw accelerator . the proposed architecture includes a unified memory arrangement and dedicated alus for kyber and dilithium capable of accelerating several polynomial operations such as number theoretic transform  ntt  inverse ntt coefficient wise multiplication  cwm  modular addition and subtraction modular reduction and the multiply accumulate operation. cryphtor has been integrated into two socs  one based on a 64 bit risc v processor and the other on a 32 bit risc v microcontroller. in these configurations up to 26x and 300x of speedup has been obtained for the ntt and up to 30x and 140x of speedup for the matrix vector multiplication compared to the software implementation running on the risc v processors.", "Doi": "10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3367109", "Key Words": ["module learning with errors", "crystals-kyber", "crystals-dilithium", "fpga", "postquantum cryptography"]}
