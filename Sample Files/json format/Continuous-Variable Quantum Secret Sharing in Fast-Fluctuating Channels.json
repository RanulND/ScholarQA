{"Title": "Continuous-Variable Quantum Secret Sharing in Fast-Fluctuating Channels", "Authors": ["f. yang", "d. qiu", "p. mateus"], "Pub Date": "2023-11-06", "Abstract": "recently several continuous variable quantum secret sharing  cv qss  protocols were proposed while most of them are limited to the fiber channel systems with a relatively stable transmissivity. however by means of complex channels the transmissivity fluctuates dramatically in time with a probability distribution which will lead to a fast fluctuating attack. therefore the security analysis of cv qss in fiber channels may not apply to cv qss in complex channels. in this article we study the cv qss protocol in the absence of uniform fast fluctuating channels whose transmissivity changes with respect to a uniform probability distribution. we give a lower bound of secret key rate to provide security analysis against the fast fluctuating attack for the cv qss protocol. in particular the realistic highly asymmetric beam splitter  habs  in cv qss protocol is investigated in detail here for the first time and numerical simulation shows that the security bound is overestimated when the habs is treated as the perfect device.", "Doi": "10.1109/TQE.2023.3322171", "Key Words": ["continuous-variable (cv)", "quantum key distribution", "quantum secret sharing (qss)"]}
