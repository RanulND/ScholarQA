{"Title": "Enhancing the Reach and Reliability of Quantum Annealers by Pruning Longer Chains", "Authors": ["r. ayanzadeh", "m. qureshi"], "Pub Date": "2024-02-26", "Abstract": "analog quantum computers  qcs  such as d wave quantum annealers  qas  and quera neutral atom platform rival their digital counterparts in computing power. existing qas boast over 5700 qubits but their single instruction operation model prevents using swap operations for making physically distant qubits adjacent. instead qas use an embedding process to chain multiple physical qubits together representing a program qubit with higher connectivity and reducing effective qa capacity by up to 33x. we observe that post embedding nearly 25% of physical qubits remain unused becoming trapped between chains. additionally we observe a \u201a\u00e4\u00fapower law\u201a\u00e4\u00f9 distribution in the chain lengths where a few dominant chains possess significantly more qubits thereby exerting a considerably more significant impact on both qubit utilization and isolation. leveraging these insights we propose skipper a software technique designed to enhance the capacity and fidelity of qas by skipping dominant chains and substituting their program qubit with two measurement outcomes. using a 5761 qubit qa we observed that by skipping up to eleven chains the capacity increased by up to 59%  avg 28%  and the error decreased by up to 44%  avg 33% .", "Doi": "10.1109/LCA.2023.3340030", "Key Words": ["adiabatic quantum computing", "embedding", "power-law", "quantum annealers"]}
