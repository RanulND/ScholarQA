{"Title": "Quantifying the Uncertainty of Sensitivity Coefficients Computed From Uncertain Compound Admittance Matrix and Noisy Grid Measurements", "Authors": ["r. k. gupta"], "Pub Date": "2024-01-04", "Abstract": "the power flow sensitivity coefficients  pfscs  are widely used in the power system for expressing linearized dependencies between the controlled  i.e. the nodal voltages lines currents  and control variables  e.g. active and reactive power injections transformer tap positions . the pfscs are often computed by knowing the compound admittance matrix of a given network and the grid states. however when the branch parameters  or admittance matrix  are inaccurate or known with limited accuracy the computed pfscs cannot be relied upon. uncertain pfscs when used in control can lead to infeasible control set points. in this context this article presents a method to quantify the uncertainty of the pfscs from uncertain branch parameters and noisy grid state measurements that can be used for formulating safe control schemes. we derive an analytical expression using the error propagation principle. the developed tool is numerically validated using monte carlo  mc  simulations.", "Doi": "10.1109/TIM.2023.3345914", "Key Words": ["least-squares", "measurement-based estimation", "power-flow sensitivity coefficients (pfscs)", "uncertainty propagation"]}
