{"Title": "ABAEKS: Attribute-Based Authenticated Encryption With Keyword Search Over Outsourced Encrypted Data", "Authors": ["f. luo", "h. wang", "c. lin", "x. yan"], "Pub Date": "2023-08-16", "Abstract": "the widespread adoption of cloud computing and the exponential growth of data highlight the need for secure data sharing and querying. attribute based keyword search  abks  has emerged as an efficient means of searching encrypted data stored in the cloud. however existing abks schemes incur high end to end delay and are vulnerable to quantum computer attacks and or  insider  keyword guessing attacks  kga . to address these vulnerabilities this paper introduces a new concept called attribute based authenticated encryption with keyword search  abaeks  and proposes an efficient abaeks scheme. our abaeks has low end to end delay and is resistant to both quantum computer attacks and  insider  kga. in addition we formalize the security model of abaeks system and prove its security in the random oracle model. finally we conduct a comprehensive performance evaluation of abaeks and the experimental results show that our abaeks is computationally efficient and outperforms current state of the art abks schemes.", "Doi": "10.1109/TIFS.2023.3301740", "Key Words": ["cloud computing", "searchable encryption (se)", "attribute-based keyword search (abks)", "lattice-based cryptography", "(insider) keyword guessing attacks (kga)"]}
