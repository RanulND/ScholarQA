{"Title": "Partition-A-Medical-Image: Extracting Multiple Representative Subregions for Few-Shot Medical Image Segmentation", "Authors": ["y. zhu", "s. wang", "t. xin", "z. zhang", "h. zhang"], "Pub Date": "2024-04-08", "Abstract": "few shot medical image segmentation  fsmis  is a more promising solution for medical image segmentation tasks where high quality annotations are naturally scarce. however current mainstream methods primarily focus on extracting holistic representations from support images with large intra class variations in appearance and background and encounter difficulties in adapting to query images. in this work we present an approach to extract multiple representative subregions from a given support medical image enabling fine grained selection over the generated image regions. specifically the foreground of the support image is decomposed into distinct regions which are subsequently used to derive region level representations via a designed regional prototypical learning  rpl  module. we then introduce a novel prototypical representation debiasing  prd  module based on a two way elimination mechanism that suppresses the disturbance of regional representations by a self support multidirection self debiasing  ms  block and a support query interactive debiasing  id  block. finally an assembled prediction  ap  module is devised to balance and integrate predictions of multiple prototypical representations learned using stacked prd modules. results obtained through extensive experiments on three publicly accessible medical imaging datasets demonstrate consistent improvements over the leading fsmis methods. the source code is available at https //github.com yazhouzhu19/pami.", "Doi": "10.1109/TIM.2024.3381715", "Key Words": ["few-shot learning (fsl)", "medical image segmentation", "prototype learning", "representation debiasing"]}
