{"Title": "Forward Secure Offline Assisted Group Key Exchange From Isogeny-Based Blinded Key Encapsulation Mechanism", "Authors": ["s. shaw", "r. dutta"], "Pub Date": "2023-06-19", "Abstract": "group key exchange is a promising cryptographic protocol that has been studied extensively over the years. however an overwhelming majority of them involve interaction among users. this makes them unsuitable in a cloud based outsourced storage systems where users seek to store and share their files with their collaborators who stay offline until they want to access the file. to address this concern boyd et al. designed an offline assisted group key exchange   $\\textsf {oagke}$   protocol that offers forward secrecy. the core component of their  $\\textsf {oagke}$  protocol is a variant of key encapsulation mechanism   $\\textsf {kem}$   called blinded  $\\textsf {kem}$    $\\textsf {bkem}$  . however their constructions of  $\\textsf {bkem}$  are susceptible to quantum attacks. this work proposes an isogeny based  $\\textsf {bkem}$  and a forward secure  $\\textsf {oagke}$  that is secure against adversaries equipped with quantum computers. our construction of  $\\textsf {bkem}$  is based on the commutative supersingular isogeny diffie hellman   $\\textsf {csidh}$   cryptosystem. we provide a formal security proof demonstrating the security of our scheme. furthermore we manifest an instantiation of our  $\\textsf {bkem}$  from  $\\textsf {csidh 512}$  parameter set. finally we present our isogeny based  $\\textsf {oagke}$  protocol along with its rigorous security analysis.", "Doi": "10.1109/TIT.2023.3260005", "Key Words": ["isogenies", "blinded key encapsulation", "cloud-storage", "group key exchange", "forward secrecy"]}
