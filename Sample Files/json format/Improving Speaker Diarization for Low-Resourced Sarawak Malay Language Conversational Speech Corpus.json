{"Title": "Improving Speaker Diarization for Low-Resourced Sarawak Malay Language Conversational Speech Corpus", "Doi": "10.1109/IALP61005.2023.10337314", "Authors": ["m. z. rahim", "s. s. juan", "f. s. mohamad"], "Key Words": ["speaker diarization", "x-vectors", "clustering", "low-resource", "auto-labeling", "pseudo-labeling", "unsupervised"], "Abstract": "speaker diarization plays a vital role in speech transcription involving conversations as it improves the transcribed content accuracy comprehension and usability. by having a speech transcription diarized the conversation data has a more structured presentation allowing for a variety of applications that rely on accurate speaker attribution. even so speaker diarization is a field that has been less explored for low resourced languages as current resources that have been optimized and applied in speaker diarization are mostly for more developed and well resourced languages such as english spanish or french. in this paper we propose an approach to using pseudo labelled speech data to perform self training on the x vector models to improve diarization accuracy. the proposed method uses almost 13 hours sarawak malay unlabeled conversational speech corpus obtained from the kalaka  language map of malaysia website for training as well as 1 hour and 26 minutes of manually labeled sarawak malay speech data for testing and evaluation. we demonstrate how speaker diarization models can be fine tuned with the pseudo labeled data.", "Pub Date": "2023-12-12"}
