{"Title": "From Classical to Quantum: Uniform Continuity Bounds on Entropies in Infinite Dimensions", "Authors": ["s. becker", "n. datta", "m. g. jabbour"], "Pub Date": "2023-06-19", "Abstract": "we prove a variety of improved uniform continuity bounds for entropies of both classical random variables on an infinite state space and of quantum states of infinite dimensional systems. we obtain the first tight continuity estimate on the shannon entropy of random variables with a countably infinite alphabet. the proof relies on a new mean constrained fano type inequality. we then employ this classical result to derive a tight energy constrained continuity bound for the von neumann entropy. to deal with more general entropies in infinite dimensions e.g.  $\\alpha $  r\u221a\u00a9nyi and  $\\alpha $  tsallis entropies we develop a novel approximation scheme based on operator h\u221a\u2202lder continuity estimates. finally we settle an open problem raised by shirokov regarding the characterisation of states with finite entropy.", "Doi": "10.1109/TIT.2023.3248228", "Key Words": ["uniform continuity bounds", "entropies", "infinite-dimensional systems", "fano-type inequality", "h\u221a\u2202lder continuity", "gibbs hypothesis"]}
