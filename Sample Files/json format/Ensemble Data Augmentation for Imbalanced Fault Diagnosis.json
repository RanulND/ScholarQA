{"Title": "Ensemble Data Augmentation for Imbalanced Fault Diagnosis", "Authors": ["x. jiang", "j. zheng", "x. zhuang", "z. ge"], "Pub Date": "2023-09-11", "Abstract": "data imbalance is a prevalent issue in industrial fault diagnosis and generative adversarial networks  gans  have gained significant attention and application in recent years as a solution. gans address data imbalance by augmenting minority category data leveraging their strong generation capability. however the training process of gans often suffers from instability resulting in a skewed distribution of the generated data. to address this challenge this article proposes a novel gan based ensemble data augmentation framework that draws inspiration from ensemble learning principles. the framework aims to enhance data augmentation through the cooperative and competitive utilization of generated data. in the cooperative aspect we introduce multisource data augmentation  msda  to mitigate the problem of skewed generated data by combining multiple independently trained gans as generative sources. to further improve the diversity and efficiency of training multiple gans we incorporate cross training and parallel training techniques into the cooperative msda  referred to as ct msda . these techniques provide significant support for the practical application of our proposed method. in addition in the competitive aspect we designed a data filtering method for df ct msda. this method evaluates the generated data and selects those with higher scores for participation in the training process. finally the effectiveness of our ensemble data augmentation framework is demonstrated through exemplary industrial cases exhibiting typical data imbalance issues. our proposed method showcases outstanding performance in these scenarios further validating its superiority.", "Doi": "10.1109/TIM.2023.3307757", "Key Words": ["data augmentation", "ensemble learning", "generative adversarial networks (gans)", "imbalanced fault diagnosis"]}
