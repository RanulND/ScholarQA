{"Title": "A Flexible NTT-Based Multiplier for Post-Quantum Cryptography", "Authors": ["k. koleci", "p. mazzetti", "m. martina", "g. masera"], "Pub Date": "2023-01-12", "Abstract": "in this work an ntt based  number theoretic transform  multiplier for code based post quantum cryptography  pqc  is presented supporting quasi cyclic low moderate density parity check  qc ldpc mdpc  codes. the cyclic matrix product which is the fundamental operation required in this application is treated as a polynomial product and adapted to the specific case of qc mdpc codes proposed for round 3 and 4 in the national institute of standards and technology  nist  competition for pqc. the multiplier is a fundamental component in both encryption and decryption and the proposed solution leads to a flexible ntt based multiplier which can efficiently handle all types of required products where the vectors have a length \u201a\u00e2\u00e0104 and can be moderately sparse. the proposed architecture is implemented using both field programmable gate array  fpga  and application specific integrated circuit  asic  technologies and when compared with the best published results it features a 10 times reduction of the encryption times with the area increased by 3 times. the proposed multiplier incorporated in the encryption and decryption stages of a code based pqc cryptosystem leads to an improvement over the best published results between 3 to 10 times in terms of  $lc$  product  lut times latency .", "Doi": "10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3234816", "Key Words": ["number theoretic transform", "accelerator", "convolution", "polynomial product", "applied cryptography", "post-quantum cryptography", "qc-mdpc codes", "hardware design", "asic", "fpga"]}
