{"Title": "Noise-Shaping Binary-to-Stochastic Converters for Reduced-Length Bit-Streams", "Authors": ["k. papachatzopoulos", "v. paliouras"], "Pub Date": "2023-12-08", "Abstract": "stochastic computations have attracted significant attention for applications with moderate fixed point accuracy requirements as they offer minimal complexity. in these systems a stochastic bit stream encodes a data sample. the derived bit stream is used for processing. the bit stream length determines the computation latency for bit serial implementations and hardware complexity for bit parallel ones. noise shaping is a feedback technique that moves the quantization noise outside the bandwidth of interest of a signal. this article proposes a technique that builds on noise shaping and reduces the length of the stochastic bit stream required to achieve a specific signal to quantization noise ratio  sqnr . the technique is realized by digital units that encode binary samples into stochastic streams hereafter called as binary to stochastic converters. furthermore formulas are derived that relate the bit stream length reduction to the signal bandwidth. first order and second order converters that implement the proposed technique are analyzed. two architectures are introduced distinguished by placing a stochastic converter either inside or outside of the noise shaping loop. the proposed bit stream length reduction is quantitatively compared to conventional binary to stochastic converters for the same signal quality level. departing from conventional approaches this article employs bit stream lengths that are not a power of two and proposes a modified stochastic to binary conversion scheme as a part of the proposed binary to stochastic converter. particularly sqnr gains of 29.8 db and 42.1 db are achieved for the first order and second order converters compared to the conventional converters for equal length bit streams and low signal bandwidth. the investigated converters are designed and synthesized at a 28 nm fdsoi technology for a range of bit widths.", "Doi": "10.1109/TETC.2023.3299516", "Key Words": ["noise shaping", "sigma-delta modulators", "stochastic bit-stream", "stochastic computing", "digital filtering"]}
