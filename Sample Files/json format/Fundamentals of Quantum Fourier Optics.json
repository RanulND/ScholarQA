{"Title": "Fundamentals of Quantum Fourier Optics", "Authors": ["m. rezai", "j. a. salehi"], "Pub Date": "2022-12-26", "Abstract": "all quantum signal processing techniques are at the core of the successful advancement of most information based quantum technologies. this article develops coherent and comprehensive methodologies and mathematical models to describe fourier optical signal processing in full quantum terms for any input quantum state of light. we begin this article by introducing a spatially 2 d quantum state of a photon associated with its wavefront and expressible as a 2 d creation operator. then by breaking down the fourier optical processing apparatus into its key components we strive to acquire the quantum unitary transformation or the input output quantum relation of the 2 d creation operators. subsequently we take advantage of the above results to develop and obtain the quantum analogous of a few essential fourier optical apparatuses such as quantum convolution via a 4f processing system and a quantum 4f processing system with periodic pupils. moreover due to the importance and widespread use of optical pulse shaping in various optical communications and optical sciences fields we also present an analogous system in full quantum terms namely quantum pulse shaping with an 8f processing system. finally we apply our results to two extreme examples of the quantum state of light. one is based on a coherent  glauber  state and the other on a single photon number  fock  state for each of the above optical systems. we believe the schemes and mathematical models developed in this article can impact many areas of quantum optical signal processing quantum holography quantum communications quantum radars and multiple input multiple output antennas and many more applications in quantum imaging quantum computations and quantum machine learning algorithms.", "Doi": "10.1109/TQE.2022.3224799", "Key Words": ["fourier optics", "quantum 4f-processor", "quantum 8f-processor", "quantum code division multiple access (qcdma)", "quantum convolution", "quantum fourier optics", "quantum fresnel and quantum fraunhofer region", "quantum grating", "quantum imaging", "quantum lense", "quantum optics", "quantum pulse shaping"]}
