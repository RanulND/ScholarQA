{"Title": "Quantum-Inspired Power System Reliability Assessment", "Authors": ["n. nikmehr", "p. zhang"], "Pub Date": "2023-06-19", "Abstract": "to enable an in depth study of power system operation and planning the assessment of standard reliability indices is inevitable. the monte carlo simulation  mcs  approach is a broadly used method in replacing the analytical methods in reliability indices assessment. the accuracy of mcs however highly depends on the sampling size and hence a complicated system with large number of components requires a large sampling size and daunting computational effort. to address this shortcoming this paper attempts to take advantage of potentials of the quantum computing  qc  for power system reliability assessment by realizing the following contributions  1  an innovative quantum model designed for reliability assessment  2  a quantum circuit that achieves the quadratic speed up compared to the classical mcs method  3  an efficient quantum amplitude estimation  qae  algorithm to accurately evaluate the reliability indices. the accuracy and efficacy of the quantum reliability method are extensively verified and demonstrated on both radial and mesh distribution systems.", "Doi": "10.1109/TPWRS.2022.3204393", "Key Words": ["quantum computing", "quantum amplitude estimation", "reliability assessment", "distribution systems"]}
