{"Title": "On the Implementation of Fuzzy Inference Engines on Quantum Computers", "Authors": ["g. acampora", "r. schiattarella", "a. vitiello"], "Pub Date": "2023-05-02", "Abstract": "quantum computers can be a revolutionary tool to implement inference engines for fuzzy rule based systems. in fact the use of quantum mechanical principles can enable parallel execution of fuzzy rules and allow them to be used efficiently in complex contexts such as distributed and big data environments. this article introduces the very first quantum based fuzzy inference engine that is capable of providing exponential acceleration in fuzzy rule execution compared to its classical counterpart and allows a quantum computer to be programmed by fuzzy linguistic rules. the proposed inference engine was implemented using a quantum algorithm design scheme based on the oracle notion. this scheme allows the modeling of a fuzzy rule based system as a boolean function the oracle which is able to reconstruct the relationships between the antecedent and consequent parts of fuzzy rules and can be efficiently computed on a quantum computer. the suitability of the proposed quantum algorithm for use as a fuzzy inference engine was tested in a typical benchmark scenario such as that provided by inverted pendulum control.", "Doi": "10.1109/TFUZZ.2022.3202348", "Key Words": ["fuzzy logic", "fuzzy sets", "fuzzy systems", "quantum computing"]}
