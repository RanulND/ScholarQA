{"Title": "An Optimized Hardware Implementation of Modular Multiplication of Binary Ring LWE", "Authors": ["k. shahbazi", "s. -b. ko"], "Pub Date": "2023-09-05", "Abstract": "providing end to end security is vital for most networks. emerging quantum computers make it necessary to design secure crypto systems against quantum attacks. binary ring learning with error  ring bin lwe  is a lattice based cryptography that is hard to solve by quantum computers. also this algorithm does not have costly operations in terms of area making ring bin lwe a suitable algorithm for resource constraint devices. this work presents a lightweight hardware implementation of ring bin lwe. in the proposed design a new multiplication method and design for ring bin lwe is introduced which results in latency reduction by a factor of two. using column based multiplication our design processes two consecutive coefficients in each cycle. the architecture is designed based on the proposed multiplication and contains one specific register bank with two sub bank registers. the design is implemented on the fpga platforms. the implementation results show an impressive improvement in execution time and area time metrics over previous similar works.", "Doi": "10.1109/TETC.2023.3280470", "Key Words": ["lattice-based cryptography", "binary ring lwe (ring-bin lwe)", "hardware implementation", "end-node devices"]}
