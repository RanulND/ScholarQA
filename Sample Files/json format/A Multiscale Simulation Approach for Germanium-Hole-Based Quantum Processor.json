{"Title": "A Multiscale Simulation Approach for Germanium-Hole-Based Quantum Processor", "Authors": ["t. wu", "j. guo"], "Pub Date": "2022-12-21", "Abstract": "a multiscale simulation method is developed to model a quantum dot  qd  array of germanium  ge  holes for quantum computing. guided by 3 d numerical quantum device simulations of qd structures an analytical model of the tunnel coupling between the neighboring hole qds is obtained. two qubit entangling quantum gate operations and quantum circuit characteristics of the qd array processor are then modeled. a device analysis of two qubit ge hole quantum gates demonstrates faster gate speed smaller process variability and less stringent requirement of feature size compared to its silicon counterpart. the multiscale simulation method allows the assessment of the quantum processor circuit performance from a bottom up physics informed perspective. the application of the simulation method to the ge qd array processor indicates its promising potential for preparing high fidelity ansatz states in quantum chemistry simulations.", "Doi": "10.1109/TCAD.2022.3166107", "Key Words": ["germanium", "hole", "multiscale simulation", "quantum computing", "quantum dot (qd)", "quantum gate"]}
