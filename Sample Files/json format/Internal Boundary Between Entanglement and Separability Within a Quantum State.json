{"Title": "Internal Boundary Between Entanglement and Separability Within a Quantum State", "Authors": ["b. -h. wang"], "Pub Date": "2022-12-22", "Abstract": "quantum states are the key mathematical objects in quantum mechanics and entanglement lies at the heart of the nascent fields of quantum information processing and computation. however there has not been a general necessary and sufficient and operational separability condition to determine whether an arbitrary quantum state is entangled or separable. in this paper we show that whether a quantum state is entangled or not is determined by a threshold within the quantum state. we first introduce the concept of finer and optimal separable states based on the properties of separable states in the role of higher level witnesses. then we show that any bipartite quantum state can be decomposed into a convex mixture of its optimal entangled state and its optimal separable state. furthermore we show that whether an arbitrary quantum state is entangled or separable as well as positive partial transposition  ppt  or not is determined by the robustness of its optimal entangled state to its optimal separable state with reference to a crucial threshold. moreover for an arbitrary quantum state we provide operational algorithms to obtain its optimal entangled state its optimal separable state its best separable approximation  bsa  decomposition and its best ppt approximation decomposition. and the open question of how to calculate the bsa in high dimension systems is partially done.", "Doi": "10.1109/TIT.2022.3204712", "Key Words": ["best separable approximation", "crucial threshold", "internal structure", "operational algorithms", "quantum entanglement"]}
