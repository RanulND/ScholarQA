{"Title": "A Quantum Tanimoto Coefficient Fidelity for Entanglement Measurement", "Authors": ["y. zhao", "f. xiao", "m. aritsugi", "w. ding"], "Pub Date": "2023-01-20", "Abstract": "fidelity plays an important role in quantum information processing which provides a basic scale for comparing two quantum states. at present one of the most commonly used fidelities is uhlmann jozsa  u j  fidelity. however u j fidelity needs to calculate the square root of the matrix which is not trivial in the case of large or infinite density matrices. moreover u j fidelity is a measure of overlap which has limitations in some cases and cannot reflect the similarity between quantum states well. therefore a novel quantum fidelity measure called quantum tanimoto coefficient  qtc  fidelity is proposed in this paper. unlike other existing fidelities qtc fidelity not only considers the overlap between quantum states but also takes into account the separation between quantum states for the first time which leads to a better performance of measure. specifically we discuss the properties of the proposed qtc fidelity. qtc fidelity is compared with some existing fidelities through specific examples which reflects the effectiveness and advantages of qtc fidelity. in addition based on the qtc fidelity three discrimination coefficients d1qtc d2qtc and d3qtc are defined to measure the difference between quantum states. it is proved that the discrimination coefficient d3qtc is a true metric. finally we apply the proposed qtc fidelity based discrimination coefficients to measure the entanglement of quantum states to show their practicability.", "Doi": "10.1109/JAS.2022.106079", "Key Words": ["distance measure", "entanglement measurement", "fidelity measure", "quantum tanimoto coefficient (qtc)", "similarity measure", "uncertainty"]}
