{"Title": "Complex-Valued Depthwise Separable Convolutional Neural Network for Automatic Modulation Classification", "Authors": ["c. xiao", "s. yang", "z. feng"], "Pub Date": "2023-08-08", "Abstract": "automatic modulation classification  amc  is a critical task in industrial cognitive communication systems. existing state of the art methods typified by real valued convolutional neural networks have introduced innovative solutions for amc. however such models viewed the two constituent components of complex valued modulated signals as discrete real valued inputs causing structural phase damage to original signals and reduced interpretability of the model. in this article a novel end to  end amc model called a complex valued depthwise separable convolutional neural network  cdscnn  is proposed which adopts complex valued operation units to enable automatic complex valued feature learning specifically tailored for amc. considering the limited hardware resources available in industrial scenarios complex valued depthwise separable convolution  cdsc  is designed to strike a balance between classification accuracy and model complexity. with an overall accuracy  oa  of 62.63% on the radioml2016.10a dataset cdscnn outperforms its counterparts by 1%\u201a\u00e4\u00ec11%. after fine tuning on the radioml2016.10b dataset the oa reaches 63.15% demonstrating the robust recognition and generalization capability of cdscnn. moreover the cdscnn exhibits lower model complexity compared to other methods.", "Doi": "10.1109/TIM.2023.3298657", "Key Words": ["automatic modulation classification (amc)", "complex-valued convolutional neural network (cnn)", "deep learning", "depthwise separable convolution (dsc)", "lightweight design"]}
