{"Title": "Distributed Transport Protocols for Quantum Data Networks", "Authors": ["y. zhao", "c. qiao"], "Pub Date": "2023-12-19", "Abstract": "quantum computing holds great promise and this work proposes to use new quantum data networks  qdns  to connect multiple small quantum computers to form a cluster. such a qdn differs from existing quantum key distribution  qkd  networks in that the former must deliver data quantum bits  i.e. qubits  reliably between different quantum computers. two families of qdns are studied one using teleportation named tele qdn and the other using tell and go  tag  named tag qdn. in order to provide reliable delivery of data qubits while addressing qdn specific constraints imposed by quantum physics laws such as the no cloning theorem and limited availability of quantum memory two corresponding transport layer protocols suitable for distributed implementation are designed and evaluated. such distributed quantum transport protocols  dtps  named tele dtp and tag dtp are the first of its kind and are complementary to existing works on the protocol stack for qdns which are at the network layer and below. both analysis and extensive simulations show that the proposed dtps can achieve high throughput and fairness. this study also offers new insights into potential tradeoffs involved in using different types of qdns.", "Doi": "10.1109/TNET.2023.3262547", "Key Words": ["quantum networks", "transport protocols", "teleportation", "tell-and-go"]}
