{"Title": "A Low-Insertion Loss Cryogenic Edge-Mode Isolator With 18 GHz Bandwidth", "Authors": ["l. zeng", "c. -y. e. tong", "s. n. paine"], "Pub Date": "2023-10-04", "Abstract": "cryogenic isolators play an important role in low noise receiver systems widely employed in millimeter and submillimeter telescopes. to enable a significantly wider intermediate frequency  if  bandwidth there is strong demand for a wideband low loss isolator in modern facilities like the submillimeter array  sma  and atacama large millimeter submillimeter array  alma . in this article we present a novel cryogenic edge mode isolator that incorporates an innovative circuit design. operating at a cryogenic temperature of 4 k this isolator delivers unprecedented performance covering a frequency range from 4 ghz to 22 ghz. it exhibits insertion loss of less than 1 db together with return loss below  15 db. in particular it provides an isolation better than 17 db across most of the band a significant improvement over the previous generation of edge mode isolators. this new isolator design is suitable for a wide array of low noise receiver applications from radio astronomy to quantum computing.", "Doi": "10.1109/JMW.2023.3307297", "Key Words": ["calcium vanadium", "ferrite devices", "isolators", "millimeter wave and terahertz components", "quantum computing", "radio astronomy", "yig"]}
