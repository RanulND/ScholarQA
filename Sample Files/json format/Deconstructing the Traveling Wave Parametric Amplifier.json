{"Title": "Deconstructing the Traveling Wave Parametric Amplifier", "Authors": ["m. malnou", "j. aumentado"], "Pub Date": "2024-04-04", "Abstract": "traveling wave parametric amplifiers  twpas  play a prominent role in modern superconducting quantum computing efforts. they are valued for their relatively high power handling capability bandwidth and simple operation. however the core mechanism for producing gain in these systems is based on very long nonlinear transmission lines that can be difficult to engineer for ideal behavior and require additional bulky passive components to adequately isolate quantum circuits. in this article we describe our attempt to distill the core principle of traveling wave amplifier operation and discuss prospects for extending this approach to building much smaller discrete circuits that possess some of the advantageous properties of twpas specifically directional gain with a simple pumping scheme.", "Doi": "10.1109/TMTT.2024.3367176", "Key Words": ["amplifiers", "josephson junctions", "josephson parametric amplifier (jpa)", "low-noise amplifier (lna)", "parametric amplifiers", "quantum computing", "traveling-wave parametric amplifiers"]}
