{"Title": "BERT Goes to SQL School: Improving Automatic Grading of SQL Statements", "Doi": "10.1109/CSCE60160.2023.00019", "Authors": ["p. rivas", "d. r. schwartz", "e. quevedo"], "Key Words": ["bert", "sql", "natural language processing", "machine learning", "deep learning"], "Abstract": "automated grading of sql queries is a challenging task due to the complexity of the language and the variety of acceptable solutions for a given problem. in this paper we propose a novel approach that leverages deep learning with a bert model to understand the syntax and semantics of sql statements. by training bert on a dataset of sql queries and their corresponding grades we create a model that can automatically grade new questions accurately. our experiments demonstrate that the proposed methodology achieves high accuracy and consistency in grading sql queries outperforming existing state of the art models. furthermore we provide an analysis of the model explainability revealing a new capability that can be extremely beneficial for understanding the decision making process. overall our work demonstrates the potential of deep learning with bert for improving the efficiency and accuracy of sql query grading.", "Pub Date": "2024-04-09"}
