{"Title": "On the Hardness of the Minimum Distance Problem of Quantum Codes", "Authors": ["u. kapshikar", "s. kundu"], "Pub Date": "2023-09-15", "Abstract": "we study the hardness of the problem of finding the distance of quantum error correcting codes. the analogous problem for classical codes is known to be np hard even in approximate form. for quantum codes various problems related to decoding are known to be np hard but the hardness of the distance problem has not been studied before. in this work we show that finding the minimum distance of stabilizer quantum codes exactly or approximately is np hard. this result is obtained by reducing the classical minimum distance problem to the quantum problem using the cws framework for quantum codes which constructs a quantum code using a classical code and a graph. a main technical tool used for our result is a lower bound on the so called graph state distance of 4 cycle free graphs. in particular we show that for a 4 cycle free graph  $g$  its graph state distance is either  $\\delta $  or  $\\delta +1$  where  $\\delta $  is the minimum vertex degree of  $g$ . due to a well known reduction from stabilizer codes to css codes our results also imply that finding the minimum distance of css codes is also np hard.", "Doi": "10.1109/TIT.2023.3286870", "Key Words": ["stabilizer codes", "cws codes", "graph states", "minimum distance"]}
