{"Title": "Evaluating Object (Mis)Detection From a Safety and Reliability Perspective: Discussion and Measures", "Authors": ["a. ceccarelli", "l. montecchi"], "Pub Date": "2023-05-11", "Abstract": "we argue that object detectors in the safety critical domain should prioritize detection of objects that are most likely to interfere with the actions of the autonomous actor. especially this applies to objects that can impact the actor\u201a\u00e4\u00f4s safety and reliability. to quantify the impact of object  mis detection on safety and reliability in the context of autonomous driving we propose new object detection measures that reward the correct identification of objects that are most dangerous and most likely to affect driving decisions. to achieve this we build an object criticality model to reward the detection of the objects based on proximity orientation and relative velocity with respect to the subject vehicle. then we apply our model on the recent autonomous driving dataset nuscenes and we compare nine object detectors. results show that in several settings object detectors that perform best according to the nuscenes ranking are not the preferable ones when the focus is shifted on safety and reliability.", "Doi": "10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3272979", "Key Words": ["autonomous driving", "object detection", "safety", "reliability"]}
