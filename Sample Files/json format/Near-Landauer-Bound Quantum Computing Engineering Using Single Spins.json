{"Title": "Near-Landauer-Bound Quantum Computing Engineering Using Single Spins", "Authors": ["f. z. wang"], "Pub Date": "2023-10-11", "Abstract": "quantum computing engineering integrates quantum electronic engineering and computer science required to develop quantum computer hardware and software. in this study we used four experiments  a single spin experiment a giant spin experiment a nanomagnet experiment and the stern\u201a\u00e4\u00ecgerlach experiment  to demonstrate that a single spin was much more energy efficient due to its small size and weak coupling with the surroundings. we conclude that quantum spintronics with a single spin as a qubit is a near landauer bound computing engineering. this means that it is approaching the theoretical limit on the minimum amount of energy required to perform a computation as defined by landauer principle. our study is also the first experimental verification of landauer bound on a single spin which is the smallest information carrier in size.", "Doi": "10.1109/TQE.2023.3269039", "Key Words": ["adiabatic quantum computer", "computing engineering", "landauer's bound", "perturbation theory", "quantum spin electronics (spintronics)", "quantum spin tunneling", "qubit", "stern\u201a\u00e4\u00ecgerlach experiment"]}
