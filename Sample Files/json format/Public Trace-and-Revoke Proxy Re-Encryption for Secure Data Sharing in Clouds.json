{"Title": "Public Trace-and-Revoke Proxy Re-Encryption for Secure Data Sharing in Clouds", "Authors": ["f. luo", "h. wang", "w. susilo", "x. yan", "x. zheng"], "Pub Date": "2024-02-01", "Abstract": "proxy re encryption  pre  as a promising cryptographic primitive for secure data sharing in clouds has been widely studied for decades. pre allows the proxies to use the re encryption keys to convert ciphertexts computed under the delegator\u201a\u00e4\u00f4s public key into ones that can be decrypted using the delegatees\u201a\u00e4\u00f4 secret keys without knowing anything about the underlying plaintext. this delegable property of decryption rights enables flexible cloud data sharing but it raises an important issue  if some proxies reveal their re encryption keys or collude with some delegatees to create a pirate decoder then anyone who gains access to the pirate decoder can decrypt all ciphertexts computed under the delegator\u201a\u00e4\u00f4s public key without the delegator\u201a\u00e4\u00f4s permission. this paper opens up a potentially new avenue of research to address the above  re encryption  key abuse problem by proposing the first public trace and revoke pre system where the malicious delegatees and proxies involved in the generation of a pirate decoder can be identified by anyone who gains access to the pirate decoder and their decryption capabilities can subsequently be revoked by the content distributor. our construction is multi hop supports user revocation and public  black box  traceability and achieves significant efficiency advantages over previous constructions. technically our construction is a generic transformation from inner product functional pre  ipfpre  that we introduce to trace and revoke pre. in addition we instantiate our generic construction of trace and revoke pre from the learning with errors  lwe  assumption which was widely believed to be quantum resistant. this is achieved by proposing the first lwe based ipfpre scheme which may be of independent interest. finally we conduct a comprehensive performance evaluation of our lwe based trace and revoke pre scheme and the experimental results show that the proposed lwe based trace and revoke pre scheme is practical and outperforms current state of the art traceable pre schemes.", "Doi": "10.1109/TIFS.2024.3357240", "Key Words": ["cloud computing", "data sharing", "proxy re-encryption", "tracing", "trace-and-revoke pre"]}
