{"Title": "A Cryo-CMOS PLL for Quantum Computing Applications", "Authors": ["j. gong", "e. charbon", "f. sebastiano", "m. babaie"], "Pub Date": "2023-04-24", "Abstract": "this article presents the first cryogenic phase locked loop  pll  operating at 4.2 k. the pll is designed for the control system of scalable quantum computers. the specifications of pll are derived from the required control fidelity for a single qubit operation. by considering the benefits and challenges of cryogenic operation a dedicated analog pll structure is used so as to maintain high performance from 300 to 4.2 k. the pll incorporates a dynamic amplifier based charge domain sub sampling phase detector  pd  which simultaneously achieves low phase noise  pn  and low reference spur thanks to its high phase detection gain and minimized periodic disturbances on the voltage controlled oscillator  vco  control. fabricated in a 40 nm cmos process the pll achieves \u201a\u00e0\u00ed78.4 dbc reference spur 75 fs rms jitter and 4 mw power consumption at 300 k when generating a 10 ghz carrier leading to a \u201a\u00e0\u00ed256.5 db jitter power fom. at 4.2 k the pll synthesizes 9.4  to 11.6 ghz tones with an rms jitter of 37 fs and a reference spur of \u201a\u00e0\u00ed69 dbc while consuming 2.7 mw at 10 ghz.", "Doi": "10.1109/JSSC.2022.3223629", "Key Words": ["charge-sampling", "cryo-cmos", "cryo-cmos pll", "dynamic amplifier", "dynamic-amplifier-based phase detector (pd)", "in-band phase noise (pn)", "low jitter", "phase-locked loop (pll)", "quantum computing", "reference spur"]}
