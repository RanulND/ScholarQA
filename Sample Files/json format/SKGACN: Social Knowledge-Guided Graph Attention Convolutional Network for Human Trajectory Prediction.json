{"Title": "SKGACN: Social Knowledge-Guided Graph Attention Convolutional Network for Human Trajectory Prediction", "Authors": ["k. lv", "l. yuan"], "Pub Date": "2023-06-20", "Abstract": "pedestrian trajectory prediction is crucial in driverless applications. to accurately predict the high quality trajectory of pedestrians it is necessary to consider the reasonable social interaction and the spatiotemporal relationships between pedestrians. previous methods could not accurately capture the social features of pedestrians in realistic congested situations and extract spatiotemporal interaction features with high computation. therefore in this article a novel prediction model is proposed called the social knowledge guided graph attention convolutional network  skgacn  which aims to address the social interactions and the spatiotemporal relationships between pedestrians with low computational requirements. specifically the social knowledge guided graph attention mechanism fully considers multiple information relative to pedestrians to capture their social interaction. for spatiotemporal interactions an improved temporal convolution network  tcn  model is used as it can parallelize the processing times to get a higher efficiency compared to traditional models. compared to the state of the art methods we evaluate our proposed method after applying it on two public datasets  eth and ucy . the experimental results show that our method performs better in terms of average displacement error  ade  and final displacement error  fde  metrics.", "Doi": "10.1109/TIM.2023.3283544", "Key Words": ["graph attention", "pedestrian trajectory prediction", "social knowledge guided", "temporal convolution"]}
