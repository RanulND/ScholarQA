{"Title": "L2Net: Infrared and Visible Image Fusion Using Lightweight Large Kernel Convolution Network", "Authors": ["l. chang", "y. huang", "q. li", "w. su", "y. zhang"], "Pub Date": "2023-11-08", "Abstract": "the existing infrared and visible image fusion methods typically apply small kernel convolution that can extract local information or details of the source images but cannot easily perceive their global information. this article proposes a lightweight large kernel convolution network for infrared and visible image fusion l2net primarily comprising three parts  shallow feature extraction deep feature extraction and fused image reconstruction. the shallow feature extraction part extracts the shallow initial features of the input images and the deep feature extraction part outputs the final fused features from the initial features using large kernel feature extraction  lkfe  modules. the lkfe contains a large kernel attention  lka  block and a small kernel skip  sks  block which help l2net to simultaneously extract the global and local information from the source images. the large kernel convolution in l2net is decomposed into three lightweight convolutions to reduce the number of parameters and computational cost. in addition an edge enhancement module  eem  is designed to extract vital edge details. the fused image reconstruction part transformed the final fused features into the final fused image. experimental analysis shows that our l2net obtains better fusion performance and higher running efficiency than the previous state of the art methods. moreover object detection experiments demonstrate that our l2net\u201a\u00e4\u00f4s fused images can effectively improve detection performance.", "Doi": "10.1109/TIM.2023.3328710", "Key Words": ["edge enhancement", "feature extraction", "image fusion", "infrared image", "large kernel convolution", "visible image"]}
