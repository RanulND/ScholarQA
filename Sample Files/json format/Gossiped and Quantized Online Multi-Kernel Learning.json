{"Title": "Gossiped and Quantized Online Multi-Kernel Learning", "Authors": ["t. ortega", "h. jafarkhani"], "Pub Date": "2023-04-27", "Abstract": "in instances of online kernel learning where little prior information is available and centralized learning is unfeasible past research has shown that distributed and online multi kernel learning provides sub linear regret as long as every pair of nodes in the network can communicate  i.e. the communications network is a complete graph . in addition to manage the communication load which is often a performance bottleneck communications between nodes can be quantized. this letter expands on these results to non fully connected graphs which is often the case in wireless sensor networks. to address this challenge we propose a gossip algorithm and provide a proof that it achieves sub linear regret. experiments with real datasets confirm our findings.", "Doi": "10.1109/LSP.2023.3268988", "Key Words": ["federated learning", "gossip algorithms", "kernel-based learning", "quantization", "sensor networks"]}
