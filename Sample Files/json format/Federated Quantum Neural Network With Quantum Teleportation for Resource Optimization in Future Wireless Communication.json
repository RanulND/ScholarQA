{"Title": "Federated Quantum Neural Network With Quantum Teleportation for Resource Optimization in Future Wireless Communication", "Authors": ["b. narottama", "s. y. shin"], "Pub Date": "2023-11-14", "Abstract": "the following study introduces ft qnn a federated and quantum teleportation \u201a\u00e4\u00ecbased quantum neural network utilized to optimize resource allocation for future wireless communications. the proposed ft qnn consists of edge quantum neural networks  qnns  and a cloud qnn while quantum teleportation allows the cloud qnn to obtain the outputs of edge qnns without requiring prior measurements on the output states allowing the cloud to process the outputs directly as quantum states. as a particular case to demonstrate its applicability for wireless resource allocation ft qnn is then employed to optimize transmit power allocation coefficients in a power domain non orthogonal multiple access  noma  based system aiming to maximize the achievable sum rate. ft qnn yields lower complexity compared to a distributed qnn scheme without quantum teleportation while the numerical results also demonstrated that the ft qnn is capable to achieve a similar sum rate compared to the scheme without quantum teleportation.", "Doi": "10.1109/TVT.2023.3280459", "Key Words": ["6g", "quantum neural networks", "quantum teleportation", "wireless communications"]}
