{"Title": "Multiplanar Data Augmentation and Lightweight Skip Connection Design for Deep-Learning-Based Abdominal CT Image Segmentation", "Authors": ["w. zhang", "y. zhang", "l. zhang"], "Pub Date": "2023-11-14", "Abstract": "in recent years deep learning based computed tomography  ct  image segmentation methods show state of the art performance. however applying deep learning in ct image analysis is challenging because well annotated medical data are expensive and time consuming. this article proposes two steps to improve the abdominal ct image segmentation performance on top of the same labeled dataset. the innovations are twofold. first there are a number of medical image data augmentation methods in the literature but the volumetric measurement of ct images is not well emphasized. in this article a new 2.5 d ct image augmentation analysis is presented to alleviate the aforementioned issue from both the theoretical and experimental perspectives. the theory derived in this article provides a rationale first time in the literature for training a single model using very different ct images. the theory is verified by three 2.5 d ct image augmentation methods and their seven combinations to make full use of the existing dataset. second skip connections can greatly affect the performance of encoder\u201a\u00e4\u00ecdecoder networks which have shown effectiveness in extracting fine grained features of target objects. this article redesigns three skip connections from complex to simple based on the original transunet to extract features of different semantic scales and aggregate them at the decoder for more flexible feature fusion. the results show that a simple skip connection design may achieve better performance. extensive experiments are conducted to verify the proposed data augmentation and skip connection designs and compare with some selected state of the art methods. experimental results show that the proposed new lightweight skip connection  lsc  together with the proposed data augmentation methods can greatly improve the performance without increasing the new labeled data.", "Doi": "10.1109/TIM.2023.3328707", "Key Words": ["computed tomography (ct) image data augmentation", "deep learning", "medical image segmentation", "skip connection"]}
