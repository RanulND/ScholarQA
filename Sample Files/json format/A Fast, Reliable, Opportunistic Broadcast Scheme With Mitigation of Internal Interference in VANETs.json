{"Title": "A Fast, Reliable, Opportunistic Broadcast Scheme With Mitigation of Internal Interference in VANETs", "Authors": ["h. zhang", "x. zhang", "d. k. sung"], "Pub Date": "2023-03-07", "Abstract": "in vanets it is important to support fast and reliable multi hop broadcast for safety related applications. the performance of multi hop broadcast schemes is greatly affected by relay selection strategies. however the relationship between the relay selection strategies and the expected broadcast performance has not been fully characterized yet. furthermore conventional broadcast schemes usually attempt to minimize the waiting time difference between adjacent relay candidates to reduce the waiting time overhead which makes the relay selection process vulnerable to internal interference occurring due to retransmissions from previous forwarders and transmissions from redundant relays. in this paper we jointly take both of the relay selection and the internal interference mitigation into account and propose a fast reliable opportunistic multi hop broadcast scheme in which we utilize a novel metric called the expected broadcast speed in relay selection and propose a delayed retransmission mechanism to mitigate the adverse effect of retransmissions from previous forwarders and an expected redundancy probability based mechanism to mitigate the adverse effect of redundant relays. the performance evaluation results show that the proposed scheme yields the best broadcast performance among the four schemes in terms of the broadcast coverage ratio and the end to end delivery latency.", "Doi": "10.1109/TMC.2021.3119015", "Key Words": ["multi-hop broadcasting", "relay selection", "retransmission", "redundant relays", "vehicular ad hoc networks"]}
