{"Title": "IFCN-BIASN Based Built-In Test Signal State Recognition for Heavy-Duty Gas Turbine Controller", "Authors": ["c. huang", "y. yang"], "Pub Date": "2024-01-25", "Abstract": "built in test  bit  technology is gradually employed in predictive maintenance of equipment state. however the accurate signal state judgment of conventional bit  cbit  is affected by high false alarm rate  far . to alleviate this issue an ifcn biasn based bit signal state recognition approach for heavy duty gas turbine controller is proposed. improved fully convolutional network  ifcn  and bio inspired adaptive synaptogenesis network  biasn  are integrated in the proposed approach. the impacts of signal noise and intermittent faults on bit results are effectively reduced. at first false alarms and missed alarms are diluted by ifcn. then the remaining isolated false alarms and missed alarms are efficiently eliminated by biasn. finally the proposed approach is tested on four categories of bit signal datasets. the ablation experiments validate that the improvements of the proposed approach have played their due roles. moreover the proposed approach is able to achieve more accurate recognition results compared with the cbit and several available signal state recognition approaches.", "Doi": "10.1109/TIM.2024.3351244", "Key Words": ["bio-inspired adaptive synaptogenesis network (biasn)", "built-in test (bit)", "false alarm", "fully convolutional network (fcn)", "signal state recognition"]}
