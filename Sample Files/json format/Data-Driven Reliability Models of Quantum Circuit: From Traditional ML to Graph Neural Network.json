{"Title": "Data-Driven Reliability Models of Quantum Circuit: From Traditional ML to Graph Neural Network", "Authors": ["v. saravanan", "s. m. saeed"], "Pub Date": "2023-04-20", "Abstract": "the current advancement in quantum computers has been focusing on increasing the number of qubits and enhancing their fidelity. however the available quantum devices known as intermediate scale quantum  nisq  computers still suffer from different sources of noise that impact their reliability. thus practical noise modeling is of great importance in the development of quantum error mitigation approaches. in this article we propose a machine learning  ml  based scheme to predict the output fidelity of the quantum circuit executed on nisq devices. we show the benefit of using graph neural network  gnn  based models compared to traditional ml based models in capturing the quantum circuit structure in addition to its gates\u201a\u00e4\u00f4 features which enable characterizing unpredicted quantum circuit errors. we use different metrics to measure the fidelity of the quantum circuit output. our experimental results using different quantum algorithms executed on ibm q guadalupe quantum computer show the high prediction accuracy of our ml reliability models. our results also show that our models can guide the single qubit gate rescheduling to improve the output fidelity of the quantum circuit without the need for prior execution of dedicated calibration circuits.", "Doi": "10.1109/TCAD.2022.3202430", "Key Words": ["quantum computing", "quantum circuit", "machine learning (ml)", "reliability", "graph neural network (gnn)", "noisy intermediate-scale quantum (nisq) computer", "errors"]}
