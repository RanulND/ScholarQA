{"Title": "Voxel Graph Attention for 3-D Object Detection From Point Clouds", "Authors": ["b. lu", "y. sun", "z. yang"], "Pub Date": "2023-08-22", "Abstract": "recently 3 d object detection from lidar point clouds has advanced rapidly but the detection performance still has shortcomings in complex scenarios. in this article we introduce a novel two stage 3 d object detector that uses only raw point clouds as input. specifically we propose two novel strategies that can effectively enhance the detection performance  the feature interpolation aggregation  fia  and graph attention pooling  gap . the former is used to initialize the graph centroid features across different resolutions which is essential for constructing local graphs. the latter constructs hierarchical local graphs on multiscale voxels to extract region of interest  roi  features by considering the contributions of neighboring voxels. this enables the aggregation of more effective and robust features for detection. the proposed innovations enhance the detector\u201a\u00e4\u00f4s feature extraction capability and improve its robustness in complex scenarios. experimental results on the kitti and waymo datasets demonstrate that voxelgraph rcnn achieves competitive performance compared with the state of the art detectors. specifically the proposed model surpasses the baseline voxel r cnn by 0.43% 1.04% and 0.87% in detecting objects with easy moderate and hard difficulty levels on the kitti datasets respectively.", "Doi": "10.1109/TIM.2023.3301907", "Key Words": ["3-d object detection", "feature interpolation", "graph attention", "machine learning", "point clouds"]}
