{"Title": "Review Prediction Using Large-Scale Language Models for Serendipity-Oriented Tourist Spot Recommendation and its Evaluation", "Doi": "10.1109/IMCOM60618.2024.10418409", "Authors": ["f. guan", "d. kitayama"], "Key Words": ["large-scale language models", "recommender systems", "review generation", "serendipity"], "Abstract": "existing recommender systems often make recommendations based on the previous actions and preferences of the user and do not always provide new experiences. recommendations based on the concept of serendipity can be adapted to such problems. however in such recommendations the user may not be able to evaluate the value of the recommended content correctly  this may result in non acceptance of the recommendation. to increase acceptability we believe that reviews that users are likely to write themselves  known as predicted reviews  may be more interesting than reviews written by others. hence in this study we propose a method for generating predicted reviews using gpt 3.5 turbo as a large scale language model based on the travel purpose of the user and information on the target spot. we explain the method of review generation and describe experiments using a prototype system in which the proposed method is applied to randomly selected spots instead of recommendations based on serendipity. we conducted an evaluation experiment to compare the reviews with those written by others and confirmed that the predicted reviews based on the proposed method arouse interest in tourist attractions and encourage people to incorporate them into their travel plans. this effect is particularly pronounced for unfamiliar tourist spots.", "Pub Date": "2024-02-12"}
