{"Title": "Analysis of Adversarial Jamming From a Quantum Game Theoretic Perspective", "Authors": ["s. k. borah", "s. anand", "r. v. agarwal", "s. bitragunta"], "Pub Date": "2023-02-23", "Abstract": "over recent years quantum communication systems have demarcated themselves as promising candidates for deployment in next generation communication networks  6g and beyond . several recent experimental demonstrations of such complex systems have been highly successful and have been instrumental in transitioning this field from the theoretical to the practical domain. in this article we investigate the application of quantum game theory for the modeling and analysis of jamming in the context of quantum networks. we begin with a general model of jamming based on the colonel blotto game and generalize it to the context of quantum networks. we provide an in depth analysis of the two person quantum colonel blotto game  qcbg  in relation to classical versus classical classical versus quantum and quantum versus quantum strategies. we also investigate the nash equilibria for such games via a multiagent adversarial reinforcement learning based system. finally we discuss further optimizations on this model and outline several open problems for further research along these lines.", "Doi": "10.1109/JSYST.2022.3184297", "Key Words": ["jamming", "multiagent systems", "neural networks", "quantum communications", "quantum games", "quantum networks", "reinforcement learning"]}
