{"Title": "Self-Triggered Stabilization of Discrete-Time Linear Systems With Quantized State Measurements", "Authors": ["m. wakaiki"], "Pub Date": "2023-02-28", "Abstract": "we study the self triggered stabilization of discrete time linear systems with quantized state measurements. in the networked control system we consider sensors may be spatially distributed and be connected to a self triggering mechanism through finite data rate channels. each sensor independently encodes its measurements and sends them to the self triggering mechanism. the self triggering mechanism integrates quantized measurement data and then computes sampling times. assuming that the closed loop system is stable in the absence of quantization and self triggered sampling we propose a joint design method of an encoding scheme and a self triggering mechanism for stabilization. to deal with data inaccuracy due to quantization the proposed self triggering mechanism uses not only quantized data but also an upper bound of quantization errors which is shared with a decoder.", "Doi": "10.1109/TAC.2022.3159262", "Key Words": ["networked control systems", "quantized control", "self-triggered control"]}
