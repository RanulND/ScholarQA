{"Title": "Self-Resetting Interface Between Rapid Single-Flux-Quantum and Adiabatic Quantum-Flux-Parametron Circuits", "Authors": ["m. naruse", "n. yoshikawa", "n. takeuchi"], "Pub Date": "2023-08-10", "Abstract": "various superconductor logic families have been proposed to build energy efficient digital systems. each logic family has its respective advantages and disadvantages so in some systems it is crucial to combine different superconductor logic families. we previously developed adiabatic quantum flux parametron  aqfp /rapid single flux quantum  rsfq  hybrid systems such as a readout circuit for superconducting photon detectors and a flux bias circuit for superconducting quantum bits. to facilitate the design of aqfp rsfq hybrid systems here we propose a self resetting rsfq to aqfp  sr r2a  interface as a compact signal converter from rsfq logic into aqfp logic. the sr r2a interface comprises an rsfq latch and an aqfp comparator where the aqfp comparator detects the flux state of the rsfq latch. a previously proposed rsfq to aqfp  r2a  interface requires single flux quantum clock signals to reset the flux state of the rsfq part in the r2a interface whereas the sr r2a interface does not require such signals because the excitation current for the aqfp part also resets the flux state of the rsfq latch. this feature allows the sr r2a to be incorporated into aqfp rsfq hybrid systems without hardware overhead. we demonstrate an sr r2a interface chip fabricated with the aist 10 ka cm2 nb high speed standard process at 4.2 k in liquid helium. the experimental results indicate reasonably wide operating margins for the excitation currents and bias voltage for the sr r2a interface.", "Doi": "10.1109/TASC.2023.3299153", "Key Words": ["hybrid system", "low power", "signal conversion", "superconductor logic"]}
