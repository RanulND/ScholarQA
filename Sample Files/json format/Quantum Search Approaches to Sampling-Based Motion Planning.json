{"Title": "Quantum Search Approaches to Sampling-Based Motion Planning", "Authors": ["p. lathrop", "b. boardman", "s. mart\u221a\u2260nez"], "Pub Date": "2023-08-29", "Abstract": "in this paper we present a novel formulation of traditional sampling based motion planners as database oracle structures that can be solved via quantum search algorithms. we consider two complementary scenarios  for simpler sparse environments we formulate the quantum full path search algorithm  q fps  which creates a superposition of full random path solutions manipulates probability amplitudes with quantum amplitude amplification  qaa  and quantum measures a single obstacle free full path solution. for dense unstructured environments we formulate the quantum rapidly exploring random tree algorithm q rrt that creates quantum superpositions of possible parent child connections manipulates probability amplitudes with qaa and quantum measures a single reachable state which is added to a tree. as performance depends on the number of oracle calls and the probability of measuring good quantum states we quantify how these errors factor into the probabilistic completeness properties of the algorithm. we then numerically estimate the expected number of database solutions to provide an approximation of the optimal number of oracle calls in the algorithm. we compare the q rrt algorithm with a classical implementation and verify quadratic run time speedup in the largest connected component of a 2d dense random lattice. we conclude by evaluating a proposed approach to limit the expected number of database solutions and thus limit the optimal number of oracle calls to a given number.", "Doi": "10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3307316", "Key Words": ["sampling based motion planning", "quantum computing", "probability and statistical methods"]}
