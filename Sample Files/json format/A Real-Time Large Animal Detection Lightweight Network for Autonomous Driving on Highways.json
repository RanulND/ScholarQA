{"Title": "A Real-Time Large Animal Detection Lightweight Network for Autonomous Driving on Highways", "Doi": "10.1109/CVCI59596.2023.10397380", "Authors": ["f. wei", "w. wang"], "Key Words": ["autonomous vehicles", "object detect", "yolov5"], "Abstract": "the perception module plays a crucial role in the autonomous driving system which is a very complicated system. in contrast current perception research in the area of autonomous driving primarily focuses on the recognition of vehicles lanes and traffic signs ignoring other factors that may cause traffic accidents and fails to consider the fact that many traffic accidents on highways are caused by wild or wandering caused by animals. we conducted the following studies to close this gap in knowledge  first a dataset of 1050 photos for huge animals that could appear on highways was created. next we propose a more efficient yolo model by improving its backbone replacing the c3 module with c3ghost. the number of parameters is decreased to fewer than 3.7 million just 52.7% of yolov5s but the average accuracy for each type of animals  map% 0.5  has reached over 95%. third our ghostsort  yolonet  gs yolonet  also incorporates the deep sort algorithm to achieve real time ranging and speed assessment of numerous targets which has a very big practical application promise.", "Pub Date": "2024-01-25"}
