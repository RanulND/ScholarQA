{"Title": "Image Deblurring With Image Blurring", "Authors": ["z. li", "z. gao", "h. yi", "y. fu", "b. chen"], "Pub Date": "2023-10-12", "Abstract": "deep learning  dl  based methods for motion deblurring taking advantage of large scale datasets and sophisticated network structures have reported promising results. however two challenges still remain  existing methods usually perform well on synthetic datasets but cannot deal with complex real world blur and in addition over  and under estimation of the blur will result in restored images that remain blurred and even introduce unwanted distortion. we propose a motion deblurring framework that includes a blur space disentangled network  bsdnet  and a hierarchical scale recurrent deblurring network  hsdnet  to address these issues. specifically we train an image blurring model to facilitate learning a better image deblurring model. firstly bsdnet learns how to separate the blur features from blurry images which is adaptable for blur transferring dataset augmentation and ultimately directing the deblurring model. secondly to gradually recover sharp information in a coarse to fine manner hsdnet makes full use of the blur features acquired by bsdnet as a priori and breaks down the non uniform deblurring task into various subtasks. moreover the motion blur dataset created by bsdnet also bridges the gap between training images and actual blur. extensive experiments on real world blur datasets demonstrate that our method works effectively on complex scenarios resulting in the best performance that significantly outperforms many state of the art approaches.", "Doi": "10.1109/TIP.2023.3321515", "Key Words": ["deep learning", "disentanglement representation", "image deblurring", "image blurring", "scale-recurrent"]}
