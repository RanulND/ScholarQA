{"Title": "chatGPT vs Mentor : Programming Language Learning Assistance System for Beginners", "Doi": "10.1109/ICSECS58457.2023.10256295", "Authors": ["j. moon", "r. yang", "s. cha", "s. b. kim"], "Key Words": ["chatgpt", "mentor", "programming language", "learning assistance system"], "Abstract": "with the recent rise of large language models learning assistance systems that utilize natural language processing capabilities are gaining attention. however existing learning assistance systems mainly aim to provide answers to learners' questions and have limitations in accurately identifying individuallearning needs and analyzing questions to provide customized answers. therefore in this study we compare chatgpt and mentor responses in the process of learning a programming language and find out the limitations of each and develop a system to assist programming language learning using chatgpt. the developed system allows learners to get realtime answers from chatgpt immediately and can also provide additional personalized guidance and answers based on the mentor judgment. in addition through the analysis of learners' responses and chatgpt answers we aim to evaluate the appropriateness and accuracy of the answers and explore and suggest technical limitations and improvement measures of chatgpt. by analyzing and discussing the differences between the traditional mentoring method and the learning assist method using chatgpt we aim to diagnose the limitations of chatgpt in programming language learning. through this study we expect to develop an effective programming language learning assistance system by integrating the advantages of chatgpt and mentoring to improve learners' understanding and learning efficiency.", "Pub Date": "2023-09-26"}
