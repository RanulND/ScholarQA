{"Title": "Qubit Reduction and Quantum Speedup for Wireless Channel Assignment Problem", "Authors": ["y. sano", "m. norimoto", "n. ishikawa"], "Pub Date": "2023-08-10", "Abstract": "in this article we propose a novel method of formulating an np hard wireless channel assignment problem as a higher order unconstrained binary optimization  hubo  where the grover adaptive search  gas  is used to provide a quadratic speedup for solving the problem. the conventional method relies on a one hot encoding of the channel indices resulting in a quadratic formulation. by contrast we conceive ascending and descending binary encodings of the channel indices construct a specific quantum circuit and derive the exact numbers of qubits and gates required by gas. our analysis clarifies that the proposed hubo formulation significantly reduces the number of qubits and the query complexity compared with the conventional quadratic formulation. this advantage is achieved at the cost of an increased number of quantum gates which we demonstrate can be reduced by our proposed descending binary encoding.", "Doi": "10.1109/TQE.2023.3293452", "Key Words": ["channel assignment problem (cap)", "combinatorial optimization", "higher-order unconstrained binary optimization (hubo)", "quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (qubo)", "quantum computing"]}
