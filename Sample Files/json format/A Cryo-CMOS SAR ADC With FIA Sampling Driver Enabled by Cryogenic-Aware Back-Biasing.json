{"Title": "A Cryo-CMOS SAR ADC With FIA Sampling Driver Enabled by Cryogenic-Aware Back-Biasing", "Authors": ["g. kiene", "r. w. j. overwater", "m. babaie", "f. sebastiano"], "Pub Date": "2024-02-27", "Abstract": "this paper presents a floating inverter amplifier  fia  that performs high linearity amplification and sampling while driving a  $2\\times $  time interleaved  ti  sar adc operating from room temperature  rt  down to 4.2k. the power efficient fia samples the continuous time input signal by windowed integration thus avoiding the traditional sample and hold. cascode switching a floating supply and accurate pulse width timing calibration enable high speed operation and interleaving. in addition by exploiting the behavior of cmos devices at cryogenic temperatures forward body biasing  fbb  is pushed well beyond what is possible at rt to ensure performance down to 4.2k and its impact on the performance of cryogenic circuits is analyzed. the resulting adc implemented in 40 nm bulk cmos and including the fia driver achieves sndr=38.7db  38.2db  sfdr>50db  >50db  and fomw=25.4fj conv step  31.3 fj conv step  with nyquist rate input at 1.0gs s  0.9gs s  at 4.2k  rt  respectively.", "Doi": "10.1109/TCSI.2023.3336566", "Key Words": ["fia", "adc driver", "forward body bias", "fbb", "cryo-cmos", "quantum computing"]}
