{"Title": "A Short-Term Power Prediction Method Based on Temporal Convolutional Network in Virtual Power Plant Photovoltaic System", "Authors": ["x. zhou", "c. pang", "x. zeng", "l. jiang", "y. chen"], "Pub Date": "2023-08-17", "Abstract": "in the virtual power plant architecture based on edge computing short term photovoltaic power prediction is carried out using multisource data of photovoltaic power plants stored in photovoltaic intelligent edge terminal  pviet  which can achieve efficient dispatching and management of renewable energy by the control and coordination center thus ensuring the safe and stable operation of the power grid. therefore this article proposes a short term photovoltaic power prediction method that combines improved gray relation analysis  igra  efficient channel attention module  ecanet  and temporal convolutional network  tcn . the igra algorithm can fully explore the correlation between predicted days and historical days using meteorological environmental data from multiple sources while the deep tcn model combined with ecanet can effectively avoid the drawbacks of traditional photovoltaic power prediction models. finally using the real case of alice spring in australia the proposed method  igra eca tcn  is compared with other hybrid models in different seasons and weather conditions and the mean absolute error  mae  root mean square error  rmse  and coefficient of determination  r2  are selected as the evaluation indicators of algorithm performance. the results indicate that igra eca tcn has stronger adaptability and higher accuracy.", "Doi": "10.1109/TIM.2023.3301904", "Key Words": ["efficient channel attention module", "improved gray relation analysis (igra)", "photovoltaic power prediction", "similarity day", "temporal convolutional network (tcn)"]}
