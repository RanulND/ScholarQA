{"Title": "On the Suitability of Post-Quantum Signature Schemes for Internet of Things", "Authors": ["k. -a. shim"], "Pub Date": "2024-03-08", "Abstract": "public key cryptography  pkc  provides confidentiality data integrity and user authentication. particularly nonrepudiation authentication and integrity of transmitted messages are assured by public key  pk  signature schemes. since the presence of a large scale quantum computer would be a real threat to break currently used pk cryptographic algorithms all security protocols based on the pk cryptographic algorithms are vulnerable to quantum computer attacks. it needs to investigate possible alternatives post quantum cryptography  pqc  believed to be resistant to attacks from both classical and quantum computers. all the traditional pkc should be replaced with pqc for secure communications in post quantum era. in this work we evaluate the post quantum signature schemes in terms of various metrics performance signature key sizes energy consumption resistance to implementation attacks and adaptability to internet protocols. we then investigate their suitability for internet of things based on these metrics.", "Doi": "10.1109/JIOT.2023.3327400", "Key Words": ["energy consumption", "fault attack", "implementation attack", "post-quantum signature (pqs)", "public-key (pk) signature scheme", "side-channel attack (sca)"]}
