{"Title": "Prompting Large Language Models for Malicious Webpage Detection", "Doi": "10.1109/PRML59573.2023.10348229", "Authors": ["l. li", "b. gong"], "Key Words": ["malicious webpage detection", "large language models", "chatgpt", "prompt learning", "in-context learning"], "Abstract": "this work proposes a novel approach for malicious webpage detection by leveraging large language models  llms . unlike existing approaches that only analyze the uniform resource locators  urls  features our approach considers the web contents for identifying malicious webpages. the major challenge is the lack of large scale malicious analysis datasets with crawled web content for training previous data driven models. to mitigate the challenge we investigate prompting llms for the malicious webpage detection task thus breaking the constraint of annotated training data. by using the popular gpt 3.5 and chatgpt as our llm engines we study zero shot and few shot prompting methods to adapt those llms to perform malicious webpage detection. experimental results show that our proposed approach achieves comparable or even better performance than deep learning baselines. our analysis highlights the importance of integrating webpage content in detecting malicious urls and demonstrates the feasibility of using llms to detect cybersecurity threats.", "Pub Date": "2023-12-14"}
