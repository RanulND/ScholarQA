{"Title": "Theoretical Prediction of Mobility Improvement in GaN-Based HEMTs at High Carrier Densities", "Authors": ["i. berdalovic", "m. poljak", "t. suligoj"], "Pub Date": "2023-02-24", "Abstract": "in this article we use a semiclassical low field mobility modeling framework which includes all relevant scattering mechanisms to examine the dependence of electron mobility on 2 d electron gas  2deg  density in previously characterized high al content algan gallium nitride  gan  high electron mobility transistors  hemts  with and without an aln spacer layer. polar optical phonon  pop  scattering has previously been identified as the dominant scattering mechanism in gan based hemts at room temperature so the analysis of pop scattering rates is of particular importance. we find that the pop limited mobility in both structures decreases with increasing 2deg density up to a critical density of around  ${10}^{{13}}$  cm $^{ {2}}$  above which we observe a significant improvement of up to  ${46}\\%$  contrary to the behavior typically reported for gan hemt structures. the pop limited mobility increase is explained by the interplay of ground state energy and quasi fermi energy within the channel by which intrasubband pop emission within the ground state is suppressed at high 2deg densities. this provides a universal guideline for the design and operation of gan based hemts to achieve a minimum on resistance in switching applications at room temperature and above.", "Doi": "10.1109/TED.2023.3239057", "Key Words": ["2-d electron gas (2deg)", "charge carrier mobility", "gallium nitride (gan)", "heterojunctions", "high electron mobility transistors (hemts)", "power semiconductor devices", "quantum well devices", "semiconductor device modeling"]}
