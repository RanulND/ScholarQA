{"Title": "Integrating RC6 Stream Cipher to a Chaotic Synchronization System", "Authors": ["f. -h. hsiao", "s. -w. chang"], "Pub Date": "2024-02-23", "Abstract": "with the advancement of technology convenient communication fills every part of people\u201a\u00e4\u00f4s lives. however the data may be stolen during the transmission process. therefore this study proposes a method based on the takagi sugeno  t s  fuzzy model using the rivest cipher 6  rc6  algorithm in multiple time delay chaotic systems. rc6 can be parameterized to support longer key lengths and encryption rounds and rc6 has excellent computing speed and security. nevertheless quantum computers are getting universal. studies have shown that existing encryption algorithms are unreliable in terms of security. due to the mighty computing power of quantum computers various encryption algorithms including rc6 will be cracked in a short period of time. because chaos has the characteristics of disarray and irregularities a systematic design combining chaotic synchronization with rc6 is presented to conduct double encryption to prevent attacks. in addition we employ the improved genetic algorithm  iga  to seek better fuzzy controller feedback gains than those sought by the genetic algorithm approach as well as the linear matrix inequality approach and then to accelerate the synchronization. subsequently a synthesized fuzzy controller realizes exponential synchronization and achieves the optimal  $h^{\\mathrm {\\infty }}$ performance at the same time. finally the effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated by an example with simulations.", "Doi": "10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3364702", "Key Words": ["chaotic masking", "rivest cipher 6 algorithm", "double encryption", "exponential synchronization", "optimal h\u201a\u00e0\u00fb control", "improved genetic algorithm"]}
