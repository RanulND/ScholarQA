{"Title": "Quantum Machine Learning Revolution in Healthcare: A Systematic Review of Emerging Perspectives and Applications", "Authors": ["u. ullah", "b. garcia-zapirain"], "Pub Date": "2024-01-25", "Abstract": "quantum computing  qc  stands apart from traditional computing systems by employing revolutionary techniques for processing information. it leverages the power of quantum bits  qubits  and harnesses the unique properties exhibited by subatomic particles such as superposition entanglement and interference. these quantum phenomena enable quantum computers to operate on an entirely different level exponentially surpassing the computational capabilities of classical computers. by manipulating qubits and capitalising on their quantum states qc holds the promise of solving complex problems that are currently intractable in the case of traditional computers. the potential impact of qc extends beyond its computational power and reaches into various critical sectors including healthcare. scientists and engineers are working diligently to overcome various challenges and limitations associated with qc technology. these include issues related to qubit stability error correction scalability and noise reduction. in such a scenario our proposed work provides a concise summary of the most recent state of the art based on articles published between 2018 and 2023 in the healthcare domain. additionally the approach follows the necessary guidelines for conducting a systematic literature review. this includes utilising research questions and evaluating the quality of the articles using specific metrics. initially a total of 2038 records were acquired from multiple databases with 468 duplicate records and 1053 records unrelated to healthcare subsequently excluded. a further 258 68 and 39 records were eliminated based on title abstract and full text criteria respectively. ultimately the remaining 49 articles were subject to evaluation thus providing a brief overview of the recent literature and contributing to existing knowledge and comprehension of quantum machine learning  qml  algorithms and their applications in the healthcare sector. this analysis establishes a foundational framework for forthcoming research and development at the intersection of qc and machine learning ultimately paving the way for innovative approaches to addressing complex challenges within the healthcare domain.", "Doi": "10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3353461", "Key Words": ["quantum computing", "quantum machine learning algorithms", "healthcare", "systematic review"]}
