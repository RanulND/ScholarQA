{"Title": "Object Oriented BDD and Executable Human-Language Module Specification", "Doi": "10.1109/SNPD-Winter57765.2023.10223873", "Authors": ["e. lee", "j. gong", "q. cao"], "Key Words": ["oobdd (object-oriented behavior driven development)", "gpt", "sdd (specification driven development)", "bdd", "hlp (human language programming)", "llm (large language model)", "generative ai"], "Abstract": "this paper presents an approach to software development which uses a generative ai model as compiler to translate human language requirements into high level programming language. we propose an executable human language module specification and a tool to support it which has been used successfully for human language ui test automation. we anticipate further development of this approach to enable complex software to be programmed in human language allowing for more intuitive and efficient software development.", "Pub Date": "2023-08-28"}
