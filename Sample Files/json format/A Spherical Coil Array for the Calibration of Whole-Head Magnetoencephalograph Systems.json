{"Title": "A Spherical Coil Array for the Calibration of Whole-Head Magnetoencephalograph Systems", "Authors": ["y. adachi", "d. oyama", "m. higuchi", "g. uehara"], "Pub Date": "2023-04-24", "Abstract": "we proposed a spherical coil array for determining the positions orientations and sensitivities of the magnetometers for whole head magnetoencephalograph  meg  systems. the coil array comprises 16 concentric and symmetrically oriented circular coils with a diameter of 150 mm which is larger than those of conventional calibration coil arrays such as 5 or 60 mm. the accuracy of the calibration was expected to improve because the relative mechanical errors in machining and assembly could be reduced when the coil diameter was increased. moreover we also proposed a method to estimate the uncertainties in calibration and it was demonstrated that the sensor parameters of each sensor were successfully obtained with uncertainties using a spherical calibration coil array. additionally the accuracy of the calibration was evaluated using a dry type meg phantom and as expected it was found that the accuracy was improved from that of a conventional calibration coil array composed of an assembly of multiple three axis bobbins.", "Doi": "10.1109/TIM.2023.3265750", "Key Words": ["calibration", "magnetoencephalography", "magnetometers", "superconducting quantum interference devices (squids)", "uncertainty estimation"]}
