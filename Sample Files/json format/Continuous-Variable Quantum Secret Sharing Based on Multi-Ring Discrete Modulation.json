{"Title": "Continuous-Variable Quantum Secret Sharing Based on Multi-Ring Discrete Modulation", "Authors": ["q. liao", "x. liu", "b. ou", "x. fu"], "Pub Date": "2023-10-17", "Abstract": "we propose a continuous variable quantum secret sharing scheme based on multi ring discrete modulation which we called mr cvqss. in this scheme phase shift keying  psk  modulated coherent states are allowed to be further discretely modulated with different amplitudes so that these modulated coherent states can be scattered on different amplitude rings in phase space. the advantage for this multi ring structure is that the error probability of quantum detector for discriminating discretely modulated coherent states  dmcss  is more lower than that of original single ring discretely modulated cvqss which is beneficial for improving the performance of whole cvqss system. we derive the security bound for mr cvqss against both eavesdroppers and dishonest users and the numerical simulation shows that the performance of mr cvqss in terms of both maximal transmission distance and maximal available number of users can be largely improved. moreover security analysis shows that the modulation variance of mr cvqss does not need to be very small thereby improving the signal to noise ratio  snr  of whole cvqss system.", "Doi": "10.1109/TCOMM.2023.3299978", "Key Words": ["quantum secret sharing", "discrete modulation", "multi-ring"]}
