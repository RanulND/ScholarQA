{"Title": "Accelerated Text Data Augmentation Using a Paraphrase Generation Model with Round-Trip Translation as a Supervisor", "Doi": "10.1109/ICMLA58977.2023.00162", "Authors": ["s. tanaka", "h. iima"], "Key Words": ["machine learning", "natural language processing", "data augmentation"], "Abstract": "machine learning requires large amounts of data to improve model performance. however preparing them is costly so data augmentation is often used to generate new data from existing data. in natural language processing there is a text data augmentation technique called round trip translation which translates text data into another language and then translates it back into the original language to generate a paraphrase of the original text. however the round trip translation is computationally expensive and time consuming because it requires two translations for one text. in this paper we propose a faster text augmentation method using a model trained to make the round trip translation. the dataset of this training consists of original texts and the results of their round trip translation. text  to  text transfer transformer  t5  is adopted as the model. experimental results show that the proposed method can augment text data about 4 times faster than round trip translation while maintaining the same level of accuracy improvement for text classification tasks.", "Pub Date": "2024-03-19"}
