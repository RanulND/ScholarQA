{"Title": "Parallel Quantum Rapidly-Exploring Random Trees", "Authors": ["p. lathrop", "b. boardman", "s. mart\u221a\u2260nez"], "Pub Date": "2024-04-04", "Abstract": "in this paper we present the parallel quantum rapidly exploring random tree  pq rrt  algorithm a parallel version of the quantum rapidly exploring random trees  q rrt  algorithm. parallel quantum rrt is a parallel quantum algorithm formulation of a sampling based motion planner that uses quantum amplitude amplification to search databases of reachable states for addition to a tree. in this work we investigate how parallel quantum devices can more efficiently search a database as the quantum measurement process involves the collapse of the superposition to a base state erasing probability information and therefore the ability to efficiently find multiple solutions. pq rrt uses a manager parallel quantum workers formulation inspired by traditional parallel motion planning to perform simultaneous quantum searches of a feasible state database. we present symbolic runtime comparisons between parallel architectures then results regarding likelihoods of multiple parallel units finding any and all solutions contained with a shared database with and without reachability errors allowing efficiency predictions to be made. we offer simulations in dense obstacle environments showing efficiency density heatmap and speed comparisons for pq rrt against q rrt classical rrt and classical parallel rrt. we then present quantum database annealing a database construction strategy that uses a temperature construct to define database creation over time for balancing exploration and exploitation.", "Doi": "10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3383313", "Key Words": ["sampling-based motion planning", "quantum computing", "parallel computing"]}
