{"Title": "SynShine: Improved Fixing of Syntax Errors", "Doi": "10.1109/TSE.2022.3212635", "Authors": ["t. ahmed", "n. r. ledesma", "p. devanbu"], "Key Words": ["deep learning", "program repair", "naturalness"], "Abstract": "novice programmers struggle with the complex syntax of modern programming languages like java and make lot of syntax errors. the diagnostic syntax error messages from compilers and ides are sometimes useful but often the messages are cryptic and puzzling. novices could be helped and instructors\u201a\u00e4\u00f4 time saved by automated repair suggestions when dealing with syntax errors. large samples of novice errors and fixes are now available offering the possibility of data driven machine learning approaches to help novices fix syntax errors. current machine learning approaches do a reasonable job fixing syntax errors in shorter programs but don't work as well even for moderately longer programs. we introduce synshine a machine learning based tool that substantially improves on the state of the art by learning to use compiler diagnostics employing a very large neural model that leverages unsupervised pre training and relying on multi label classification rather than autoregressive synthesis to generate the  repaired  output. we describe synshine architecture in detail and provide a detailed evaluation. we have built synshine into a free open source version of visual studio code  vscode   we make all our source code and models freely available.", "Pub Date": "2023-04-18"}
