{"Title": "ShoppingGPT: A GPT-based Product Recommendation Dialogue System", "Doi": "10.1109/PRML59573.2023.10348314", "Authors": ["r. yu", "y. guan", "y. zhan"], "Key Words": ["product recommendation", "dialogue system", "gpt", "language model", "fine-tuning"], "Abstract": "this article introduces a shopping recommendation dialogue system called shoppinggpt which aims to help people get comprehensive product recommendations based on individual needs and preferences. the system can leverage existing large scale generative pre trained models with the ability to communicate and understand human language to provide more detailed and comprehensive product recommendations through multiple conversations with users. by constructing the shopping recommendation dataset and using the large scale language model fine tuning methods we successfully fine tuned on a large scale language model and transformed the shopping recommendation task into a sequential labeling task to adapt to our shopping recommendation dialogue system. and we design a specific method for unlabeled prompt which uses the basic language knowledge of large scale language models to output product information for unsupervised annotation for product recommendation. in the experiment we evaluate several existing language model fine tuning techniques and explore the generalization ability of the shoppinggpt system on unlabeled samples. we also compared models before and after fine tuning to see what the models learned from the data. in the discussion section we provide a detailed analysis of the advantages and limitations of shoppinggpt and its potential applications in the shopping field. in addition we explore the potential security challenges that shoppinggpt can pose and discuss how to address them. finally we discussed how to improve shoppinggpt to make it perform better and more secure.", "Pub Date": "2023-12-14"}
