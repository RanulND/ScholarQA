{"Title": "IMep: Device-Free Multiplayer Step Counting With WiFi Signals", "Authors": ["j. he", "w. yang"], "Pub Date": "2023-08-31", "Abstract": "currently most of the mature wifi based step applications can only count the steps of a single individual and their methods cannot capture amplitude information about each person overall actions in multiuser scenes. it is still a challenging task to build a multiplayer step counting system in a device free manner. in this paper we present imep a novel device free system based on wifi that can obtain the amplitude information of each person overall step actions and count the steps of multiple people simultaneously. our main strategy is to establish a multiplayer stepping amplitude relation model  msarm  and design a multiplayer amplitude decomposition algorithm  mada  that uses block term decomposition  btd . moreover we put forward a new moving energy method  mem  that captures each person step number more clearly and accurately. the experimental results show that imep can function successfully in an environment of up to 7 people. the accuracies in three different room settings are 95.57% 94.66% and 89.94% respectively suggesting that imep is effective in multi person scenarios.", "Doi": "10.1109/TMC.2022.3186473", "Key Words": ["wifi signals", "channel state information", "multiplayer", "device-free", "block term decomposition"]}
