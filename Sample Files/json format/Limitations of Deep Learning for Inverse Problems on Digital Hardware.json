{"Title": "Limitations of Deep Learning for Inverse Problems on Digital Hardware", "Authors": ["h. boche", "a. fono", "g. kutyniok"], "Pub Date": "2023-11-27", "Abstract": "deep neural networks have seen tremendous success over the last years. since the training is performed on digital hardware in this paper we analyze what actually can be computed on current hardware platforms modeled as turing machines which would lead to inherent restrictions of deep learning. for this we focus on the class of inverse problems which in particular encompasses any task to reconstruct data from measurements. we prove that finite dimensional inverse problems are not banach mazur computable for small relaxation parameters. even more our results introduce a lower bound on the accuracy that can be obtained algorithmically.", "Doi": "10.1109/TIT.2023.3326879", "Key Words": ["computing theory", "deep learning", "signal processing", "turing machine"]}
