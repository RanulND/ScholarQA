{"Title": "Toward Head Computed Tomography Image Reconstruction Standardization With Deep-Learning-Assisted Automatic Detection", "Authors": ["b. zheng", "c. huang", "x. chen", "y. luo"], "Pub Date": "2023-12-22", "Abstract": "three dimensional reconstruction of head computed tomography  ct  images elucidates the intricate spatial relationships of tissue structures thereby assisting in accurate diagnosis. nonetheless securing an optimal head ct scan without deviation is challenging in clinical settings owing to poor positioning by technicians patient\u201a\u00e4\u00f4s physical constraints or ct scanner tilt angle restrictions. manual formatting and reconstruction not only introduce subjectivity but also strain time and labor resources. to address these issues we propose an efficient automatic head ct images 3 d reconstruction method improving accuracy and repeatability as well as diminishing manual intervention. our approach uses a deep learning based object detection algorithm identifying and evaluating orbitomeatal line landmarks to automatically reformat the images prior to reconstruction. given the dearth of existing evaluations of object detection algorithms in the context of head ct images we compared 12 methods from both theoretical and experimental perspectives. by exploring their precision efficiency and robustness we singled out the lightweight yolov8 as the aptest algorithm for our task with an map of 92.77% and impressive robustness against class imbalance. our qualitative evaluation of standardized reconstruction results demonstrates the clinical practicability and validity of our method.", "Doi": "10.1109/TIM.2023.3329102", "Key Words": ["3-d reconstruction", "deep learning", "head computed tomography (ct) images", "object detection", "orbitomeatal line landmarks"]}
