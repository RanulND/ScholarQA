{"Title": "Verifiable Blind Quantum Computation With Identity Authentication for Multi-Type Clients", "Authors": ["j. quan", "q. li", "l. li"], "Pub Date": "2023-12-29", "Abstract": "blind quantum computation  bqc  provides a solution for clients with limited quantum capabilities to delegate their quantum computational tasks to remote quantum servers while keeping their own data private. in this paper we first propose three multi party verifiable blind quantum computation  mpvbqc  protocols each of which can handle one type of clients with certain simple quantum capabilities such as making single qubit measurements preparing single qubits or performing a few single qubit gates. then a flexible and hybrid mpvbqc framework for multi type clients in quantum networks is given by combining the three proposed mpvbqc protocols. it simultaneously allows at least three types of clients in quantum networks to achieve bqc depending on their own quantum devices. furthermore all the proposed protocols can achieve identity authentication resist both insider and outsider attacks and be verifiable which means that the clients can verify the correctness of their computational results.", "Doi": "10.1109/TIFS.2023.3340859", "Key Words": ["verifiable blind quantum computation", "multi-party quantum computation", "quantum network", "quantum identity authentication", "quantum cryptography"]}
