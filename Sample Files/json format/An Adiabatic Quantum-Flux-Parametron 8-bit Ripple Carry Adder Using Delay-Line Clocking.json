{"Title": "An Adiabatic Quantum-Flux-Parametron 8-bit Ripple Carry Adder Using Delay-Line Clocking", "Authors": ["t. yamae", "n. takeuchi", "n. yoshikawa"], "Pub Date": "2023-02-09", "Abstract": "adiabatic quantum flux parametron  aqfp  logic is a superconductor logic family that can operate with low switching energy due to adiabatic switching. in a previous study we proposed a low latency clocking scheme called delay line clocking in which the latency for each logic operation is determined by the propagation delay of the excitation current. we demonstrated several aqfp logic gates with delay line clocking and demonstrated a phase skipping operation in which some of the aqfp buffers for phase synchronization are removed to reduce the junction count and energy dissipation. in the present study we design and demonstrate an aqfp 8 bit ripple carry adder with delay line clocking to show that delay line clocking and the phase skipping operation are applicable to large scale aqfp circuits. the latency of this adder is 960 ps which is 40% of that for a conventional design. moreover due to the phase skipping operation the junction count is reduced to approximately 70% of that for the conventional design. we find that this adder can operate at up to 4 ghz. the above results indicate that large scale aqfp circuits can operate with low latency and low junction count by using delay line clocking and a phase skipping operation.", "Doi": "10.1109/TASC.2023.3239833", "Key Words": ["adiabatic logic", "low-latency clocking scheme", "quantum flux parametron (qfp)", "ripple carry adder"]}
