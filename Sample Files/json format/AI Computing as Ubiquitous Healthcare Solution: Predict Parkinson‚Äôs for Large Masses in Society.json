{"Title": "AI Computing as Ubiquitous Healthcare Solution: Predict Parkinson\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s for Large Masses in Society", "Authors": ["p. divyashree", "p. dwivedi"], "Pub Date": "2023-08-02", "Abstract": "parkinson\u201a\u00e4\u00f4s disease  pd  is one of the macroscale effected neurological disorders that have adverse effects on the quality of life as they influence the proper functioning of organs. to misfortune pd has limited diagnosing techniques and lacks treatment to cure at advanced stages. therefore there is a prime requirement to diagnose pd at the initial stage with the assistance of advanced technologies. this article focuses on the use of revolutionary computing technology which is artificial intelligence  artificial intelliegence  to early diagnose this fatal disorder and provide an efficient healthcare solution. the compact two dimensional convolution neural network  2 d cnn  based computing algorithm is developed to diagnose pd from the gait variation. the proposed system is able to provide promising accuracy of 98% in classifying pd that surpasses the current state of the art performance. to provide a ubiquitous healthcare solution for diagnosing pd the proposed 2 d cnn model will be a quantum leap breakthrough. consequently the progressive pd spread growth and severity can be efficiently controlled. therefore discern ubiquitous healthcare services for large masses in society.", "Doi": "10.1109/TCSS.2022.3224046", "Key Words": ["2-d cnn", "deep learning (dl)", "gait impairment", "parkinson\u201a\u00e4\u00f4s disease (pd)"]}
