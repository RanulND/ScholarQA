{"Title": "Local-to-Global Deep Clustering on Approximate Uniform Manifold", "Authors": ["t. wang", "x. zhang", "l. lan", "z. luo"], "Pub Date": "2023-04-03", "Abstract": "deep clustering usually treats the clustering assignments as supervisory signals to learn a more compact representation with deep neural networks under the guidance of clustering oriented losses. nevertheless we observe that without reliable supervision such losses for global clustering would destroy the locally geometric structure underlying data. in this paper we propose a local to global deep clustering method based on approximate uniform manifold  lgc aum  to address this issue in a two stage fashion. in the local stage an intra manifold preservation loss is proposed to preserve intra manifold structures locally on basis of approximate uniform manifold and an inter manifold discrimination loss is for global inter manifold structure. thus this stage serves to learn more discriminative structure preserving features by reducing the correlations between different manifolds which paves the way for the final clustering. build off the learned features the second stage explores a clustering loss based on approximate uniform manifold to establish stable network training for effective clustering with two auxiliary distributions. experiments on five benchmark datasets verify the efficacy of our lgc aum as compared to several well behaved clustering counterparts.", "Doi": "10.1109/TKDE.2022.3144952", "Key Words": ["manifold structure", "feature discrimination", "target distribution", "deep clustering"]}
