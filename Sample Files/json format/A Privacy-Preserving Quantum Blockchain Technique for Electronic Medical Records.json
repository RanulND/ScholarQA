{"Title": "A Privacy-Preserving Quantum Blockchain Technique for Electronic Medical Records", "Authors": ["r. venkatesh", "b. s. hanumantha"], "Pub Date": "2023-12-20", "Abstract": "nowadays electronic medical records are increasing rapidly. electronic medical records consist of sensitive and confidential information. these pieces of information need to be protected from attackers during the exchange with patients. blockchain technology can protect information from attackers during the exchange of information. there are various classical techniques to protect electronic medical records. these techniques can exchange information correctly but cannot resist collective and coherent attacks and have more communication and computation costs. in this article we introduced a privacy preserving quantum blockchain technique to protect electronic medical records. this technique can resist the intercept intercept resend entangle measure man in the middle collective and coherent attacks with less communication and computation costs.", "Doi": "10.1109/EMR.2023.3319376", "Key Words": ["electronic medical records", "privacy-preserving technique", "quantum blockchain technique"]}
