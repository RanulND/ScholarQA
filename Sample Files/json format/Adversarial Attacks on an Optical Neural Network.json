{"Title": "Adversarial Attacks on an Optical Neural Network", "Authors": ["s. jiao", "z. song", "s. xiang"], "Pub Date": "2022-09-22", "Abstract": "adversarial attacks have been extensively investigated for machine learning systems including deep learning in the electronic domain. however the adversarial attacks on optical neural networks  onns  have been seldom considered previously. in this work we first construct an accurate image classifier with an onn using a mesh of interconnected mach\u201a\u00e4\u00eczehnder interferometers  mzis . then a corresponding adversarial attack scheme is proposed for the first time. the attacked images are visually very similar to the original ones but the onn system becomes malfunctioned and generates wrong classification results in most time. the results indicate that adversarial attack is also a significant issue for optical machine learning systems.", "Doi": "10.1109/JSTQE.2022.3207056", "Key Words": ["adversarial attack", "optical neural network", "optical computing", "mach-zehnder interferometer", "machine learning"]}
