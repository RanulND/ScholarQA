{"Title": "A Fast Multiplane Segmentation Algorithm for Sparse 3-D LiDAR Point Clouds by Line Segment Grouping", "Authors": ["x. du", "y. lu", "q. chen"], "Pub Date": "2023-01-18", "Abstract": "this article describes an approach for extracting multiple planar regions in 3 d point clouds from spinning multibeam lidars. this technique benefits from the intrinsic structure of lidars and projective geometry which allows us to extract line segments efficiently in 2 d space and then cluster those line segments to form planes. to extract planes from line primitives we introduce a novel line segment grouping approach by alternatively searching candidate plane seeds of adjacent line segments and breadth first searching for neighboring lines fallen on the seeded plane. exhaustive experiments have been conducted with simulation realistic data and a public plane segmentation evaluation benchmark. experimental results show that our method works well on sparse point clouds with the fastest running speed compared to state of the art methods.", "Doi": "10.1109/TIM.2023.3234028", "Key Words": ["lidar point cloud", "line segment grouping", "plane segmentation"]}
