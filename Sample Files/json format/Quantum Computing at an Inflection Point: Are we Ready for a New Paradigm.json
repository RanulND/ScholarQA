{"Title": "Quantum Computing at an Inflection Point: Are we Ready for a New Paradigm", "Authors": ["a. bhasin", "m. tripathi"], "Pub Date": "2023-06-06", "Abstract": "quantum computers leverage quantum mechanics to enable complex processing power enabling computation within a finite timeframe. as the industry reaches a peak of uncertainties in classical computing researchers see an opportunity in quantum computing to resolve these uncertainties by unraveling the quantum mechanism that quantum physicists built for over a century. organizations and academics have been working in tandem to conceptualize the quantum world through quantum computers. this article evaluates the tipping points of the quantum computers in the organization the barrier of adoption and a mitigation strategy. the article involves an extensive literature review of the current state and future application expectations from quantum computers. as part of this article the authors interviewed senior industry technology experts to explore quantum computers\u201a\u00e4\u00f4 introduction in the industry and discussed the barriers to adopting quantum computing.", "Doi": "10.1109/TEM.2021.3103904", "Key Words": ["quantum computer introduction", "quantum computing (qc)", "qc barriers"]}
