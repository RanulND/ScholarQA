{"Title": "The Drain Bias Modulation Effect of Random Telegraph Noise in Gate-All-Around FETs for Cryogenic Applications", "Authors": ["y. sun", "p. lu", "y. ma", "c. zhang", "z. han", "b. li"], "Pub Date": "2024-03-25", "Abstract": "in this letter the random telegraph noise  rtn  in 25 nm physical channel length gate all around field effect transistors  gaa fets  are thoroughly investigated. electrical characterizations at cryogenic condition  10 k  indicate that the drain bias   ${v} {{\\textit {ds}}}$   which has little impact on the rtn in long channel transistors can strongly affect that in ultra scaled devices. an increase of 0.15 v in  ${v} {{\\textit {ds}}}$  led to a  $\\sim 10\\times $  enlargement of the statistical high state time constant   $\\tau  {c}$   together with a ~20x reduction of the statistical low state time constant   $\\tau  {e}$   which could be attributed to the more pronounced drain fringing field in short channel devices. more significantly because the drain fringing field counteracts the gate electric field the  $\\delta ~{v} {{\\textit {ds}}}$  induced  $\\tau  {c}$  and  $\\tau  {e}$  variation trends are contrary to those caused by the gate bias. an analytical model which captures the non uniform electric field profile in short channel devices has been developed for quantitative rtn analysis. single level traps close to the channel drain junction are found to be the major contributor to the rtn providing guidance for future process optimization.", "Doi": "10.1109/LED.2024.3362986", "Key Words": ["random telegraph noise", "gate-all-around fet", "cryogenic electronics", "fringing field", "trap localization"]}
