{"Title": "Two Circuits for Directing and Controlling Ballistic Fluxons", "Authors": ["r. m. lewis", "m. p. frank"], "Pub Date": "2023-02-23", "Abstract": "reversible logic schemes using flux solitons  fluxons  on long josephson junctions  ljjs  have recently been proposed. the attraction of the fluxon is that it propagates ballistically along an ljj until it encounters a change in the character of the ljj often a designed circuit element. logic gates involve fluxons interacting with circuit elements and with other fluxons. however testing of ballistic fluxon circuits requires other circuits outside the logic family to direct and control fluxon motion. we discuss two such non reversible fluxon control circuits. first the polarity filter gate is a simple non reversible gate that allows one polarity of fluxon to pass while reflecting the other polarity. in the off state both polarities reflect. second the polarity separator generalizes on the polarity filter concept and allows separation of the two fluxon polarities into different ljjs. we discuss simulations of these structures and possible applications.", "Doi": "10.1109/TASC.2023.3244115", "Key Words": ["josephson junctions", "reversible computing", "superconducting logic circuits", "transmission lines"]}
