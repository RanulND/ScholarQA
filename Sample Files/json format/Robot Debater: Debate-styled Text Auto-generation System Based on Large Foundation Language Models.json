{"Title": "Robot Debater: Debate-styled Text Auto-generation System Based on Large Foundation Language Models", "Doi": "10.1109/PRML59573.2023.10348335", "Authors": ["y. zhu", "y. ling", "x. ling", "j. yang"], "Key Words": ["large foundation model", "natural language process", "deep learning"], "Abstract": "we use a large foundation language model which is fine tuned with debate corpora to develop a robot debater application. to address the limitations of requiring immense computational power in large base language models this study takes advantage of the low rank adaption characteristic prevalent in domain expert knowledge. by applying low rank adaption technology and fine tuning with a dedicated dataset the computational load is reduced to just one thousandth of what is needed for a large language model greatly expanding the application scenarios of robot debaters using large language models. in view of the characteristics of debate competitions this model can preset a variety of debate scenarios and supports personalized debate processes. it employs intelligent voice recognition technology combined with a multi channel voice input method allowing for precise localization of different human debaters and improving the accuracy of voice input recognition. the system can support multiple large scale language generation models and utilize various different voice broadcasting systems including male and female voice styles as well as a range of voice emotions. this model can be applied to debate competitions held in universities high schools and various industries. it can support human machine debates as well as machine to machine debates.", "Pub Date": "2023-12-14"}
