{"Title": "A Variation-Aware Quantum Circuit Mapping Approach Based on Multi-Agent Cooperation", "Authors": ["p. zhu", "w. ding", "l. wei", "x. cheng", "z. guan", "s. feng"], "Pub Date": "2023-07-10", "Abstract": "quantum circuit mapping is an essential process required by executing quantum circuits using a noisy intermediate scale quantum  nisq  device. since qubits and quantum gates of a nisq device are error prone and variable in quality it is crucial to choose qubits or quantum gates in a variation aware manner to maximize the success rate of executing circuits. to this end this article proposes a variation aware method for quantum circuit mapping through the cooperation of multiple agents. each agent in the proposed method can gradually construct a physical circuit that respects the device connectivity constraints by inserting a swap gate at each step. moreover at each step the circuit information of each agent is shared within the agent population through a communication mechanism that combines global and local information exchange so that agents with poor fitness can get an opportunity to improve their physical circuits. the experimental results on extensive benchmark circuits confirm that the proposed method can effectively and consistently improve the overall circuit fidelity compared with the state of the art methods.", "Doi": "10.1109/TC.2023.3242208", "Key Words": ["multi-agent cooperation", "noisy intermediate-scale quantum (nisq)", "quantum circuit mapping", "qubit mapping", "qubit placement"]}
