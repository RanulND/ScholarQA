{"Title": "Feedback Control of Quantum Systems to Stabilize Superposition States", "Authors": ["a. daeichian"], "Pub Date": "2023-09-26", "Abstract": "as a specific trait of quantum mechanics quantum superposition is exploited in many applications such as quantum computation. this article proposes a feedback scheme to stabilize the desired quantum superposition states. to this aim a new factorization is derived for the stochastic master equation of a quantum system which is driven by the field in the superposition of coherent states. then a feedback scheme is proposed which consists of a quantum system driven by the field in the superposition of coherent states and a classical feedback channel proportional to the observations of a homodyne detector. afterward the quantum filter of the closed loop system is attained using the slh framework. finally the factorization of the closed loop quantum filter is obtained and the control law is calculated such that the proposed factorization satisfies the stabilization condition. finally as an example the control method is simulated for a two level atom and the stabilization of the superposition states is achieved.", "Doi": "10.1109/TAC.2023.3237504", "Key Words": ["quantum feedback control", "quantum filter", "superposition of coherent states", "superposition states", "two-level quantum system"]}
