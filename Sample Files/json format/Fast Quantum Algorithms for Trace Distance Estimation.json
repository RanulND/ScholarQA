{"Title": "Fast Quantum Algorithms for Trace Distance Estimation", "Authors": ["q. wang", "z. zhang"], "Pub Date": "2024-03-19", "Abstract": "in quantum information trace distance is a basic metric of distinguishability between quantum states. however there is no known efficient approach to estimate the value of trace distance in general. in this paper we propose efficient quantum algorithms for estimating the trace distance within additive error  $\\varepsilon $  between mixed quantum states of rank  $r$ . specifically we first provide a quantum algorithm using  $r \\cdot \\widetilde o \\left  {1/\\varepsilon ^{2}}\\right $  queries to the quantum circuits that prepare the purifications of quantum states. then we modify this quantum algorithm to obtain another algorithm using  $\\widetilde o \\left  {r^{2}/\\varepsilon ^{5}}\\right $  samples of quantum states which can be applied to quantum state certification. these algorithms have query sample complexities that are independent of the dimension  $n$  of quantum states and their time complexities only incur an extra  $o \\left  {\\log \\left  {n}\\right }\\right $  factor. in addition we show that the decision version of low rank trace distance estimation is  $\\mathsf {bqp}$  complete.", "Doi": "10.1109/TIT.2023.3321121", "Key Words": ["quantum algorithms", "trace distance", "singular value decomposition", "hadamard test"]}
