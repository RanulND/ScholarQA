{"Title": "Private Product Computation Using Quantum Entanglement", "Authors": ["r. b. christensen", "p. popovski"], "Pub Date": "2023-10-19", "Abstract": "in this article we show that a pair of entangled qubits can be used to compute a product privately. more precisely two participants with a private input from a finite field can perform local operations on a shared bell like quantum state and when these qubits are later sent to a third participant the third participant can determine the product of the inputs but without learning more about the individual inputs. we give a concrete way to realize this product computation for arbitrary finite fields of prime order.", "Doi": "10.1109/TQE.2023.3320052", "Key Words": ["multiparty computation", "privacy", "quantum entanglement"]}
