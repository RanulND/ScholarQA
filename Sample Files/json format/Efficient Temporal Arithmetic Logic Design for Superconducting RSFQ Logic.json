{"Title": "Efficient Temporal Arithmetic Logic Design for Superconducting RSFQ Logic", "Authors": ["d. vasudevan", "g. michelogiannakis"], "Pub Date": "2023-06-27", "Abstract": "in this paper we propose a temporal decimal multiplier design that reduces the area and pin count compared to an equivalent binary multiplier. in this design we have efficiently embedded time to decimal conversion inside the logic which mitigates the need for external conversion circuits. also our design mitigates a drawback of temporal logic that typically requires \u201a\u00e4\u00f2n\u201a\u00e4\u00f4 time delays to represent \u201a\u00e4\u00f2n\u201a\u00e4\u00f4 numerical values which results in longer latency for large values of \u201a\u00e4\u00f2n\u201a\u00e4\u00f4. by representing numbers as parallel temporal values where each value represents a different digit  0\u201a\u00e4\u00ec9  of the number we reduce the maximum delay needed to represent the product to only 9 delay  clock  cycles for any multiplication outcome. we show performance and area benefits for different temporal multiplier designs with fully laid out tapeout ready design implemented in mitll sfq5ee process. compared to a 4 bit binary multiplier our temporal decimal multiplier reduces the pin count by approximately 3\u221a\u00f3 and the area by 40%. finally we evaluate our proposed temporal multiplier against conventional binary multipliers when configured for dsp and machine learning algorithms.", "Doi": "10.1109/TASC.2023.3248003", "Key Words": ["rsfq logic", "temporal/time-domain logic", "time-to-digital conversion", "digital-to-time conversion", "multiplier", "digital signal processing"]}
