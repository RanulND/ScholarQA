{"Title": "An Open Problem About Monomial Bent Functions", "Authors": ["h. hu", "b. wang", "x. xie", "y. luo"], "Pub Date": "2023-11-27", "Abstract": "in 2018 pott et al. investigated vectorial functions with maximal number of bent components. they found one class of binomial functions attaining the upper bound. they also proposed an open problem regarding monomial functions that have the maximal number of bent components. in this paper we solve this open problem. specifically we prove that if  $k\\geq 2$  then  $x^{s 2^{k}+1 }$  are the only monomial functions over  $\\mathbb {f} {2^{2k}}$  that have the maximal number of bent components where  $s\\in \\{1 2 2^{2} \\ldots 2^{k 1}\\}$ . as a consequence we also solve an open problem of ness and helleseth about the cross correlation function between two sequences in 2006.", "Doi": "10.1109/TIT.2023.3311583", "Key Words": ["bent function", "finite field", "hamming weight", "walsh transform", "vectorial function"]}
