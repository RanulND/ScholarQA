{"Title": "Multi-Line Superconducting Waveguides Based on YBCO-on-Kapton Technology", "Authors": ["v. solovyov", "h. kim", "p. farrell"], "Pub Date": "2024-01-18", "Abstract": "coplanar  with the ground  and stripline 25 cm long waveguides are manufactured from the ybco kapton material. the waveguides are intended as the key components of a scalable signal delivery for large quantum computing systems and detectors. the waveguide is coupled with an integrated power divider that replaces the standard attenuator. the divider is designed to return most of the power to the previous thermalization stage. the method is projected to reduce the active dissipation by \u201a\u00e2\u00e010. we investigate the effect of internal strain in ybco layer on the device mechanical stability. we show that adhesives with high stiffness are essential for the reliability of ybco kapton devices.", "Doi": "10.1109/TASC.2023.3347187", "Key Words": ["high-temperature superconductors", "quantum computing", "rf properties", "scalable interface"]}
