{"Title": "Learning-Based Auction for Matching Demand and Supply of Holographic Digital Twin Over Immersive Communications", "Authors": ["x. zhang", "m. xu", "r. tan", "d. niyato"], "Pub Date": "2024-04-04", "Abstract": "digital twin  dt  technologies create digital models of physical entities frequently in multimedia forms which are crucial for concurrent simulation and analysis of real world systems. in displaying dts holographic type communication  htc  provides immersive multimedia access for users to interact with holographic dts  hdts  by transmitting holographic data such as light field  lf  and other multisensory information. hdt has applications in remote education work and social interactions. however the effective matching of demand and supply between hdt users and providers remains a challenge. to address this issue we propose a hierarchical architecture that integrates the dt and htc paradigms. this architecture incorporates a marketplace for hdt services leveraging a formulated double dutch auction  dda  mechanism to optimize matching and pricing based on user and provider valuation. furthermore we employ an actor critic based deep reinforcement learning  drl  algorithm to train a dda auctioneer that dynamically adjusts auction clocks during the auction process. as an alternative to the multi layer perceptron  mlp  we experiment with a deep simplistic variational quantum circuit  dsvqc  to reduce the number of parameters and enhance performance stability. our simulations reveal that the proposed learning based auctioneer achieves 92% optimal social welfare at a 37% auction information exchange cost for an mlp based actor and 99% optimal social welfare at a 77% auction information exchange cost for a dsvqc based actor.", "Doi": "10.1109/TMM.2023.3340548", "Key Words": ["auction theory", "digital twin", "holographic-type communication", "immersive communication", "machine learning"]}
