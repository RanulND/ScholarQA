{"Title": "Trajectory-Robust RFID Relative Localization Based on Phase Profile Correlation", "Authors": ["k. chen", "y. ma", "h. liu", "x. liang", "y. fu"], "Pub Date": "2023-01-18", "Abstract": "indoor localization systems based on radio frequency identification  rfid  technologies are widely adopted in the internet of things  iot . many of these applications prefer to obtain the relative position of the target object rather than the absolute position. existing relative positioning methods are subject to strict trajectory constraints and cannot work under nonstraight trajectories. rfid mobile localization which has high accuracy can also be used for relative positioning but they require the acquisition of precise moving trajectory coordinates. to overcome these challenges we propose a trajectory robust relative localization algorithm  trl  based on phase profiles\u201a\u00e4\u00f4 correlation in this article. the intuition of trl is that the phase of the backscattered signal has a linear mapping relationship with the distance between the reader and the antenna so the closer the tag is to each other the higher the correlation of their phase curves is. we use the dynamic time warping  dtw  algorithm to calculate the correlation between the phase profiles of different tags and achieve relative localization of all the tags by sequentially determining their position intervals in the tag sequence. compared with the state of the art solutions trl gives greater flexibility to antenna movement and the demand for trajectory coordinates and is it fully robust to trajectory error. a series of experimental results show that trl has significant advantages over the current state of the art schemes in terms of both accuracy and computation time.", "Doi": "10.1109/TIM.2022.3223149", "Key Words": ["mobile inventory", "phase correlation", "radio frequency identification (rfid)", "relative localization"]}
