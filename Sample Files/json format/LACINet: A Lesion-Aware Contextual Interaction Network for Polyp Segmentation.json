{"Title": "LACINet: A Lesion-Aware Contextual Interaction Network for Polyp Segmentation", "Authors": ["w. li", "w. lu", "j. chu", "f. fan"], "Pub Date": "2023-10-19", "Abstract": "automatic polyp segmentation is critical for early prevention and diagnosis of colorectal cancer  crc . however diverse foreground appearance and complicated background interference severely degrade the performance of pixel level prediction. the excessive computational overheads further hinder the practical clinical applications of the existing methods. in this article we propose a novel lesion aware contextual interaction network  lacinet  which aims to explore the long range dependencies and global contexts with friendly computing resource consumption for polyp segmentation. specifically we present a lesion aware pyramid mechanism  lpm  to weaken the influence of background noise and refine lesion related features. we also develop a robust representation enhancement decoder  red  to learn global feature representations and aggregate the multilevel contexts. in red we first build a nonlocal contextual lesion interaction module  nclim  to integrate the cross level contextual information for obtaining the intrinsic feature representations and then design a tri branching multiscale perceptual self attention module  tmpsm  to sufficiently excavate the global features. notably we introduce an asymmetric multibranch strategy to alleviate the computational burden. the experimental results on several widely used benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed lacinet in comparison with state of the art methods.", "Doi": "10.1109/TIM.2023.3322994", "Key Words": ["colonoscopy", "multiscale perceptual self-attention", "nonlocal contextual interaction", "polyp segmentation"]}
