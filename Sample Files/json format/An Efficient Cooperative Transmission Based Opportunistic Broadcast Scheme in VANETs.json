{"Title": "An Efficient Cooperative Transmission Based Opportunistic Broadcast Scheme in VANETs", "Authors": ["h. zhang", "x. zhang", "d. k. sung"], "Pub Date": "2023-02-03", "Abstract": "in vehicular ad hoc networks  vanets  quick and reliable multi hop broadcasting is important for the dissemination of emergency warning messages. by scheduling multiple nodes to transmit messages concurrently and cooperatively cooperative transmission based broadcast schemes may yield much better broadcast performance than conventional broadcast schemes. however a cooperative transmission requires multiple relays to achieve strict synchronization on both time and frequency which may induce high cost for a cooperative transmission process. in this paper we analyze the cost and benefit of a cooperative transmission for data broadcasting in vehicular networks and introduce a new metric called the single hop broadcast efficiency  sbe  to evaluate the overall broadcast performance. we propose an efficient non deterministic cooperation mechanism to reduce the cooperation cost. the mechanism maximizes the expected broadcast performance by selecting cooperators with the largest expected sbe value for a lead relay and initiates cooperative broadcasting process when the expected sbe value is larger than that of a single relay based broadcasting. based on the non deterministic mechanism we propose an efficient cooperative transmission based opportunistic broadcast  ectob  scheme which further utilizes rebroadcast to improve the reliability of the broadcast scheme. simulation results show that the proposed scheme outperforms the conventional ones.", "Doi": "10.1109/TMC.2021.3105982", "Key Words": ["cooperative transmission", "opportunistic broadcast", "vehicular ad hoc networks"]}
