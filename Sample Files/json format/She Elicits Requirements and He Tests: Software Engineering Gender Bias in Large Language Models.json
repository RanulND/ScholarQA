{"Title": "She Elicits Requirements and He Tests: Software Engineering Gender Bias in Large Language Models", "Doi": "10.1109/MSR59073.2023.00088", "Authors": ["c. treude", "h. hata"], "Key Words": ["gender bias", "large language models", "software engineering"], "Abstract": "implicit gender bias in software development is a well documented issue such as the association of technical roles with men. to address this bias it is important to understand it in more detail. this study uses data mining techniques to investigate the extent to which 56 tasks related to software development such as assigning github issues and testing are affected by implicit gender bias embedded in large language models. we systematically translated each task from english into a genderless language and back and investigated the pronouns associated with each task. based on translating each task 100 times in different permutations we identify a significant disparity in the gendered pronoun associations with different tasks. specifically requirements elicitation was associated with the pronoun \u201a\u00e4\u00fahe\u201a\u00e4\u00f9 in only 6% of cases while testing was associated with \u201a\u00e4\u00fahe\u201a\u00e4\u00f9 in 100% of cases. additionally tasks related to helping others had a 91% association with \u201a\u00e4\u00fahe\u201a\u00e4\u00f9 while the same association for tasks related to asking coworkers was only 52%. these findings reveal a clear pattern of gender bias related to software development tasks and have important implications for addressing this issue both in the training of large language models and in broader society.", "Pub Date": "2023-07-12"}
