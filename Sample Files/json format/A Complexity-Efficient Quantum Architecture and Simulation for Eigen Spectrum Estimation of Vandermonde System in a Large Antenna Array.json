{"Title": "A Complexity-Efficient Quantum Architecture and Simulation for Eigen Spectrum Estimation of Vandermonde System in a Large Antenna Array", "Authors": ["m. r. laskar", "a. k. dutta"], "Pub Date": "2023-04-27", "Abstract": "vandermonde matrix finds a wide range of applications in the digital signal processing domain including antenna array processing. eigenspectrum estimation remains a challenge in such a system when the matrix dimension increases. this precise problem can be well addressed in a quantum simulation framework based on quantum hamiltonian simulation  qhs . however the structural exploitation of the matrix is never considered which can give benefits in terms of quantum gate complexity. in this work we exploit the special structural property of a dense vandermonde matrix by decomposing it into several sparse matrices and then use them for a complexity efficient eigenvalue spectrum estimation in a quantum framework. in this context we propose an iterative quantum simulation framework for a vandermonde structured hamiltonian called quantum vandermonde simulation  qvs . the proposed approach requires fewer quantum gate operations compared to the standard qhs of a dense vandermonde matrix. in this work we have considered a large antenna array system that exploits a delay vandermonde matrix  dvm  to create a multi beam beamformer using the proposed low complex quantum architecture. extensive theoretical and numerical analysis in terms of complexity and other quality parameters have been conducted to show the benefit of the proposed method.", "Doi": "10.1109/TCSI.2023.3247886", "Key Words": ["quantum algorithm", "vandermonde system", "hamiltonian simulation", "ula", "quantum signal processing"]}
