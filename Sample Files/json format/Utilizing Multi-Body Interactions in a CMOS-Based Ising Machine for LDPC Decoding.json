{"Title": "Utilizing Multi-Body Interactions in a CMOS-Based Ising Machine for LDPC Decoding", "Authors": ["e. elmitwalli", "z. ignjatovic", "s. kose"], "Pub Date": "2024-01-11", "Abstract": "ising machines have shown great promise in solving combinatorial optimization problems  cops  using nature inspired computation with higher speed and efficiency over traditional von neumann computing systems. cmos based implementations combine the maturity and scaling ability of cmos with the efficacy of ising machines. in this paper a low density parity check  ldpc  decoding solution is implemented with a cmos based resistively coupled ising machine known as  qubrim  using multi body interactions among cmos based ising machine nodes for the first time. state of the art cmos based ising implementations currently utilize order reduction to solve problems with higher than quadratic terms. in this paper a new mechanism is proposed to implement higher than quadratic terms on ising machines without the need for order reduction. the proposed methodology is implemented and verified with cmos technology using 45 nm generic pdk  gpdk . high accuracy rates are reported for the ldpc decoder based on the proposed methodology comparable to normalized min sum offset min sum and layered belief propagation decoders with a bit error rate  ber  as low as  $4 \\times 10^{ 8}$  at a signal to noise ratio  snr  of 4db. furthermore the proposed ldpc decoder attains a normalized energy efficiency  nee  of 1.29 pj bit/iteration surpassing the state of the art decoders by a minimum factor of 2.4 and as much as 7.6 times.", "Doi": "10.1109/TCSI.2023.3322325", "Key Words": ["combinatorial optimization problems", "ising machine", "ldpc decoding", "multi-body interaction"]}
