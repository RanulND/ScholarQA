{"Title": "IPO-PEKS: Effective Inner Product Outsourcing Public Key Searchable Encryption From Lattice in the IoT", "Authors": ["m. wang", "l. sun", "z. cao", "x. dong"], "Pub Date": "2024-02-28", "Abstract": "lightweight devices in the internet of things  iot  typically need to store massive data on a cloud server with strong processing and storage capabilities for later retrieval and usage. since these data contain the participant\u201a\u00e4\u00f4s sensitive information they cannot be delivered directly to the cloud server. public key encryption with keyword search  peks  allows customers to search for target encrypted files using keywords. however the majority of peks implementations are unable to repel malicious quantum capable attackers. and with regard to forward security they must search for many rounds to obtain the necessary data. to resolve these concerns we propose a comprehensive inner product outsourcing peks system  ipo peks  with forward security based on lwe assumptions which raises search efficiency by allowing authorized clients to find the information they desire in a single round and achieves more fine grained searches. furthermore we offer an inner product outsourcing calculation technique that allows the server to compute the inner product result without knowing the details of both parties in order to conceal the relevant privacy data of transmitting and decryption states. the paradigm can be utilized for efficient state transition through the use of parallel computing to accomplish the target of one round of iteration.", "Doi": "10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3368908", "Key Words": ["peks", "forward security", "inner product outsourcing", "lwe assumptions", "quantum-resist"]}
