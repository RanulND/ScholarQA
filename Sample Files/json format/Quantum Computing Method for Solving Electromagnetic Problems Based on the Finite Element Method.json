{"Title": "Quantum Computing Method for Solving Electromagnetic Problems Based on the Finite Element Method", "Authors": ["j. zhang", "f. feng", "q. -j. zhang"], "Pub Date": "2024-02-07", "Abstract": "applying quantum computation to solve electromagnetic  em  problems is still at an early age. recently an initial study on applying quantum computation to solve the finite element method  fem  equations in the em domain has been made. this article makes a further development beyond the initial study. specifically we first develop an approach to systematically prepare the quantum state to represent the right hand side  rhs  vector of the finite element equation in em problems. then to reduce the number of gates needed in the quantum state preparation process we propose a quantum gate reduction method which explores the fact that the fem cells in the input port are a small portion of the total cells in the 3 d em structure and that the number of gates needed for state preparation depends on the rhs vector\u201a\u00e4\u00f4s sparsity pattern. based on the proposed quantum gate reduction method we further derive the upper and lower bounds analytically for the number of gates needed in the quantum state preparation circuit. furthermore to deal with the large condition number of the finite element matrix in em we leverage a matrix preconditioner to modify the original linear equations so as to reduce the number of qubits required in using quantum computation to solve em problems. two em examples are used to illustrate how the proposed quantum computing method can be used to find solutions to em problems.", "Doi": "10.1109/TMTT.2023.3297406", "Key Words": ["electromagnetic (em)", "finite element method (fem)", "harrow\u201a\u00e4\u00echassidim\u201a\u00e4\u00eclloyd (hhl)", "quantum computing"]}
