{"Title": "Funder: Future-Proof Unbiased Decentralized Randomness", "Authors": ["z. li", "m. wang", "t. g. tan", "j. zhou"], "Pub Date": "2024-03-08", "Abstract": "a trustworthy source of randomness is a crucial component of many decentralized and crypto based application systems especially blockchain consensus. a decentralized random beacon  drb  periodically outputs a new source of randomness generated using a distributed technique such as publicly verifiable secret sharing  pvss  or distributed verifiable random functions  vrfs . these protocols offer a variety of efficiency versus randomness quality tradeoffs but guarantee security under a variety of configurations assumptions and adversarial models. this article aims to provide a future proof unbiased decentralized randomness  abbreviated as funder  via a post quantum threshold vrf for sustainable proof of stake blockchain. we also provide a generic compiler for achieving post quantum vrf from a classical vrf solution but our approach makes use of symmetric key primitives our novel compiler is validated and evaluated using the zkboo and zkb++ quantum secure zero knowledge systems respectively. the implementation of the proof of concept demonstrates that the overheads introduced by our solution are acceptable for real world deployments even in the present day. in addition we demonstrate the protocol\u201a\u00e4\u00f4s possible application in lottery based proof of stake consensus protocols.", "Doi": "10.1109/JIOT.2023.3327733", "Key Words": ["decentralized random beacon (drb)", "futureproof blockchain", "post-quantum", "verifiable random function (vrf)"]}
