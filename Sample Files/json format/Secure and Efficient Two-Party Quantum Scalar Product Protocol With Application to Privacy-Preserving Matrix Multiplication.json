{"Title": "Secure and Efficient Two-Party Quantum Scalar Product Protocol With Application to Privacy-Preserving Matrix Multiplication", "Authors": ["w. -j. liu", "z. -x. li"], "Pub Date": "2023-10-25", "Abstract": "secure two party scalar product  s2sp  is a promising research area within secure multiparty computation  smc  which can solve a range of smc problems such as intrusion detection data analysis and geometric computations. however existing quantum s2sp protocols are not efficient enough and the complexity is usually close to exponential level. in this paper a novel secure two party quantum scalar product  s2qsp  protocol based on fourier entangled states is proposed to achieve higher efficiency. firstly the definition of unconditional security under malicious models is given. and then an honesty verification method called entanglement bondage is proposed which is used in conjunction with the modular summation gate to resist malicious attacks. the property of fourierentangled states is used to calculate the scalar product with polynomial complexity. the unconditional security of our protocol is proved which guarantees the privacy of all parties. in addition we design a privacy preserving quantum matrix multiplication protocol based on s2qsp protocol. by transforming matrix multiplication into a series of scalar product processes the product of two private matrices is calculated without revealing any privacy. finally we show our protocol\u201a\u00e4\u00f4s feasibility in ibm qiskit simulator.", "Doi": "10.1109/TCSI.2023.3295891", "Key Words": ["quantum computation", "quantum communication", "secure multi-party computation", "scalar product", "matrix multiplication"]}
