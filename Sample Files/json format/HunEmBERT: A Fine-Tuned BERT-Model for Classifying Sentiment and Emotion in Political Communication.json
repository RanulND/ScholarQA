{"Title": "HunEmBERT: A Fine-Tuned BERT-Model for Classifying Sentiment and Emotion in Political Communication", "Doi": "10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3285536", "Authors": ["i. \u221a\u00faveges", "o. ring"], "Key Words": ["fine-tuned bert-model", "hubert", "emotion analysis", "sentiment analysis", "political communication"], "Abstract": "the growing number of digitally accessible text corpora and the accelerating development of nlp tools and methods  particularly the emergence of powerful large scale language models  have allowed their widespread use in various classification tasks including the vast field of sentiment analysis. however these models must often be fine tuned to perform this task efficiently. therefore we aimed to create a transformer based fine tuned model for the emotion and sentiment analysis of hungarian political texts. the training data for the model were the manually annotated parliamentary speech texts from 2014 to 2018 which have the advantage of being rich in various emotions. the compiled corpus can be freely used for research purposes. in our work we describe in detail the process of fine tuning the hungarian bert model for sentiment and emotion classification the performance achieved and the typical classification errors mainly due to a lack of recognition of pragmatic and other language use features by the fine tuned models.", "Pub Date": "2023-06-22"}
