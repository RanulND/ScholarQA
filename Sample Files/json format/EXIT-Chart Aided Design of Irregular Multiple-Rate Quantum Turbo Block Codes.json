{"Title": "EXIT-Chart Aided Design of Irregular Multiple-Rate Quantum Turbo Block Codes", "Authors": ["d. chandra", "s. x. ng", "l. hanzo"], "Pub Date": "2023-09-11", "Abstract": "we propose a novel quantum turbo short block code which subsumes multiple rate quantum short block codes  mr qsbcs  as the outer codes and a quantum unity rate code  qurc  as the inner code. the proposed design is denoted as mr qsbc qurc. more specifically the proposed design exhibits multiple quantum coding rates despite relying only on a single quantum encoder. moreover the flexibility offered by the single encoder mr qsbcs enables us to leverage extrinsic information transfer  exit  chart based heuristic optimization for determining the optimal weighting in the fractional encoding of mr qsbcs. our simulation results show that the mr qsbc qurc scheme conceived performs relatively close to the ultimate limit of the quantum hashing bound. specifically when considering the target quantum coding rates of  $r {q} = \\lbrace 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 \\rbrace $  the mr qsbc qurc operates at a distance of  $d = \\lbrace 0.042 0.029 0.030 0.024 0.017 \\rbrace $  from the quantum hashing bound respectively at a quantum bit error ratio  qber  of 10\u201a\u00e0\u00ed3.", "Doi": "10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3312044", "Key Words": ["quantum error-correction codes", "quantum stabilizer codes", "quantum turbo codes", "quantum short-block codes", "exit chart", "rate-compatible code"]}
