{"Title": "Optimized SeaSign for Enhanced Efficiency", "Authors": ["s. kim"], "Pub Date": "2024-02-08", "Abstract": "this paper optimized seasign \u201a\u00e4\u00ec an isogeny based digital signature algorithm that combines the class group actions of csidh with the notion of fiat shamir with abort. the proposed modification is simple yet powerful which is the repositioning of the rejection sampling within the algorithm. additionally seasign is further optimized by using the huff edwards hybrid isogeny. as a result the signature generation of the proposed seasign is approximately 3 times faster than the original version of seasign. additionally this paper presents the results of performance comparisons with other optimization methods of seasign. in conclusion the proposed algorithm has zero rejection rate so it demonstrates more efficient performance in any scenario.", "Doi": "10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3360297", "Key Words": ["isogeny-based cryptography", "post-quantum cryptography", "csidh", "seasign", "digital signatures"]}
