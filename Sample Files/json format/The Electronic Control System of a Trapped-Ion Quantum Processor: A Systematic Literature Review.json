{"Title": "The Electronic Control System of a Trapped-Ion Quantum Processor: A Systematic Literature Review", "Authors": ["s. castillo"], "Pub Date": "2023-07-07", "Abstract": "[background] ions in an ion trap are among the most promising technologies to implement a quantum processor. this machine is governed by a classic electronic control system for which we found no systematic electronic system level approach for its conception design implementation and or verification. the trapped ion quantum processor cannot advance its roadmap without an appropriate and fitting electronic control system. to fully enable further advancements in the field an understanding of the electronic control system as a system of its own and the conception of its electronic system level description are due needed. [objective] therefore we want to address the electronic control system of a trapped ion quantum processor as a system of its own by first identifying its published literature. [method] for that purpose we conducted a systematic literature review abiding by the apisser methodology for systematic literature reviews in engineering which describes and delimits the reach of this study. [results] in this paper we report the results of the study classify them and present possible research directions and considerations to be taken in the conception of this system. [conclusion] this study lays a introductory foundation to grasp the requirements and environment of the electronic control system of a trapped ion quantum processor. a foundation much needed to leverage further research on this topic by the engineering community. furthermore it serves as a checkpoint in time  listing and synthesizing the existing published body of knowledge of this topic within the defined boundaries of our method.", "Doi": "10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3289936", "Key Words": ["quantum computing", "processor", "trapped-ion", "electronic control system", "apisser"]}
