{"Title": "Modeling the Transimpedance Amplitude and Phase of Wideband Cage-Type Current Shunts", "Authors": ["g. a. kyriazis", "r. s. ribeiro"], "Pub Date": "2023-06-21", "Abstract": "the model for current shunts which was successfully applied in a previous work for frequencies up to 100 khz is expanded here to compute the shunt transimpedance amplitude and phase for frequencies up to 10 mhz. the model is employed to verify recent experimental findings in this frequency range aiming at predicting explaining such evidence. in general there is good agreement for phase in the whole frequency range. some differences between measured and predicted values do exist for amplitude but they are all within the uncertainties reported in the literature. anyway they deserve further investigation. despite further work being needed to clarify matters the model will be used in the design of such shunts for wideband applications.", "Doi": "10.1109/TIM.2023.3279874", "Key Words": ["ac resistance", "ac\u201a\u00e4\u00ecdc difference", "current shunts", "electric power", "transimpedance amplitude", "transimpedance phase"]}
