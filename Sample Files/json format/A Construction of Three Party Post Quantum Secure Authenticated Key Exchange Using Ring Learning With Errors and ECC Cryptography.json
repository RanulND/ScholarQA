{"Title": "A Construction of Three Party Post Quantum Secure Authenticated Key Exchange Using Ring Learning With Errors and ECC Cryptography", "Authors": ["d. chaudhary", "u. kumar", "k. saleem"], "Pub Date": "2023-12-12", "Abstract": "a three party authenticated key exchange protocol enables two entities to agree on a session key with the help of a dedicated server over a public channel. shor\u201a\u00e4\u00f4s algorithm is a big threat to existing authenticated key exchange protocols. lattice based cryptography plays a very important role in designing authentication and key agreements secure against the threat of quantum attacks. however it is not an easy job to design quantum resistant password based three party protocols due to the high demand for security requirements and the limited resources nature of mobile devices. in this article we have proposed a new post quantum three party key exchange based on ring learning with errors assumption. this protocol is motivated by islam et al.\u201a\u00e4\u00f4s authenticated key exchange protocol. their protocol is not secure against stolen smartcard attacks or password guessing attacks and can\u201a\u00e4\u00f4t provide user anonymity. anonymous communication is a big requirement for practical applications like e healthcare services smart vehicular communication. this paper also contains the performance analysis of the proposed protocol along with other relevant protocols.", "Doi": "10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3325886", "Key Words": ["key exchange", "authentication", "ring learning", "cryptography"]}
