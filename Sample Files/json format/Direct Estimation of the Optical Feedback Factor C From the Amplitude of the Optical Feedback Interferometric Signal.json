{"Title": "Direct Estimation of the Optical Feedback Factor C From the Amplitude of the Optical Feedback Interferometric Signal", "Authors": ["o. d. bernal", "h. c. seat", "u. zabit", "f. surre"], "Pub Date": "2023-08-14", "Abstract": "in this article we combine the intrinsic properties of the optical feedback factor  $c$  with a precalibration technique to assess the value of  $c$  when the laser operates in and across the weak moderate and strong feedback regimes. the proposed technique directly estimates  $c$  via the amplitude of the optical feedback signal as a first approximation. it thus requires much less computing resources than existing algorithms. experimental results show that an estimation of  $c$  with a precision better than < 8.1% after calibration has been achieved. the performance repeatability has also been quantified by running the system over several days. furthermore continually time varying  $c$  estimation has been achieved more efficiently than with previously reported techniques. this implies that it could be exploited for future real time optical feedback interferometry  ofi  systems to retrieve target displacement more accurately thereby potentially enabling operation from  $c$  extending from weak feedback to strong feedback.", "Doi": "10.1109/TIM.2023.3300431", "Key Words": ["estimation of c", "optical feedback factor", "optical feedback interferometry (ofi)", "self-mixing (sm)", "speckle"]}
