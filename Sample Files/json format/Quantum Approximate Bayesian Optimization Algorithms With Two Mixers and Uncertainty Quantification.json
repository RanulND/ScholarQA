{"Title": "Quantum Approximate Bayesian Optimization Algorithms With Two Mixers and Uncertainty Quantification", "Authors": ["j. e. kim", "y. wang"], "Pub Date": "2023-11-28", "Abstract": "the searching efficiency of the quantum approximate optimization algorithm is dependent on both the classical and quantum sides of the algorithm. recently a quantum approximate bayesian optimization algorithm  qaboa  that includes two mixers was developed where surrogate based bayesian optimization is applied to improve the sampling efficiency of the classical optimizer. a continuous time quantum walk mixer is used to enhance exploration and the generalized grover mixer is also applied to improve exploitation. in this article an extension of the qaboa is proposed to further improve its searching efficiency. the searching efficiency is enhanced through two aspects. first two mixers including one for exploration and the other for exploitation are applied in an alternating fashion. second uncertainty of the quantum circuit is quantified with a new quantum mat\u221a\u00a9rn kernel based on the kurtosis of the basis state distribution which increases the chance of obtaining the optimum. the proposed new two mixer qaboa with and without uncertainty quantification are compared with three single mixer qaboa on five discrete and four mixed integer problems. the results show that the proposed two mixer qaboa with uncertainty quantification has the best performance in efficiency and consistency for five out of the nine tested problems. the results also show that qaboa with the generalized grover mixer performs the best among the single mixer algorithms thereby demonstrating the benefit of exploitation and the importance of dynamic exploration\u201a\u00e4\u00ecexploitation balance in improving searching efficiency.", "Doi": "10.1109/TQE.2023.3327055", "Key Words": ["exploration\u201a\u00e4\u00ecexploitation", "mixed-integer optimization", "noisy intermediate-scale quantum algorithms and devices", "quantum approximate optimization algorithm", "uncertainty quantification"]}
