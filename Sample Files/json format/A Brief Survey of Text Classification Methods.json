{"Title": "A Brief Survey of Text Classification Methods", "Doi": "10.1109/ICIBA56860.2023.10165621", "Authors": ["q. jiao"], "Key Words": ["text classification", "natural language processing", "pre-trained model"], "Abstract": "text classification is a long standing research spot in natural language processing  nlp  which greatly facilitates various nlp tasks. with the rapid development of internet and social media the need for effective data management also makes text classification become more and more important. its research methodology has also developed from the early shallow classification based on handcrafted features to the deep language modeling with various neural networks. in this paper we first give a brief introduction to its background and definition and then describe its representative methods at different stages of development. meanwhile we also introduce the recently popular pre trained language models on large scale corpus and discuss their applications to text classification. overall this paper gives a quick guide to understanding text classification research.", "Pub Date": "2023-07-06"}
